<p>Perhaps the one word that best expresses the trend of education
at the present time is the word life-likeness. The trend is toward
more and more life-likeness in organization and methods. The effort
toward diversification which has resulted in putting manual training
into courses of study, in multiplying courses in high schools, in providing
ungraded and other special rooms in elementary schools, in
breaking grades up into groups for teaching and promotions, in keeping
playgrounds and shops open afternoons and Saturdays, in opening the
school buildings evenings for social centers or socialized evening schools,—which
has resulted in all these changes and others that might be
mentioned,—is simply an effort to make the schools like life. The
theory behind this is that if a school is like life, children will like
school for the same reason that they like life, and the theory is sound.
Before these changes were introduced, our public schools were a composite
structure, made up nearly altogether of two elements, neither of
which was in any degree life-like. These two elements were the
medieval monastery, for order, and the 19th century factory, for process.</p>

<p>Kite-making in connection with schools is in line with this trend
toward life-likeness. As the ideas and plans contained in this book
have been worked out and carried into execution in the schools of
Los Angeles by the author, they have demonstrated a wonderful socializing
power. By recognizing kite-season in the schools and carrying
the discussion of it into the shop and classrooms, ending with a great
kite-tournament each year, not only have very many boys been reached
who would not have responded to other influences, but the whole community
has been stirred to sympathetic interest in the schools. This is
the kind of influence which causes children to feel that school is life,
and therefore makes tremendously for wholesome education. If the
ideas and plans of the author can be carried out elsewhere as they have
been in Los Angeles for several years, they must prove a help to the
cause of education.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>When we started kite work in the Los Angeles City Schools, we
little thought that so great an opportunity for awakening latent power
in a certain class of boys was being initiated, nor did we dream of any
such kite tournaments as have been developed during the past six years.
Starting with half a dozen plans, sent out on mimeographed sheets to
the various schools from time to time during the spring of 1907, the
number of kinds and designs have increased to a hundred or more.
Other cities desiring information regarding the work, a reprint was
published and has been in such demand that it was thought advisable
to write a more comprehensive text on the subject. Many of the former
designs have been included, but none but what should be put in more
permanent form, and most of these have been redrawn for the new
work. The plans are not complete in every detail, something being left
for the boy to work out, but there is enough in the suggestions so that
by reasonable planning, most of the forms can be made by the average
boy and still something will be left for the expert.</p>

<p>The greatest number of kites will be made by fifth and sixth year
boys, but the spirit holds over into seventh and eighth for the larger
and more complex forms, and even into the high school with model
aeroplanes, etc.</p>

<p>It is the hope of the writer that this little book may be instrumental
in giving our boys and girls suggestions for many happy hours in the
construction and flying of kites, and that it may also serve a good
purpose to teacher and pupil in reaching a common ground, and that
it will help some mother in furnishing a good healthy pastime sport
for boys who sometimes try the limit of one’s patience for the lack of
something to do. It is a home construction work largely, and it has
succeeded oftimes much better than was anticipated, for whole families
have become interested in the development of OUR boy’s kite. Mother
generally is interested first, while father looks with disfavor on so much
time being spent on a kite; but before it flies, father gets very enthusiastic,
suggests here and there, and furnishes material for string,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
etc., with pleasure, and they all go to the tournament to see Jack win
a first prize. This is one case, there are others.</p>

<p>I believe there is need for such books, and this subject is without
such a text, therefore, this little treatise.</p>

<h3>GENERAL KITE CONSTRUCTION.</h3>


<p>The kite is usually made of a framework of wood, is lashed together
with cord, strung with cord according to design, and finally is covered
with paper; but in each case some other material might be substituted.</p>

<p>The drawings in this book have the framework represented by full
lines and the string by slant dotted lines. The framework must be
kept light and strong. It is usually made of wood, the pieces varying
in number from two in the plain tailless, to sixteen in a good box-kite,
and to a great many in a large tetrahedral kite.</p>

<p>The soft tough woods are better than the hard, heavy woods.
Spruce is considered the most satisfactory, but yellow pine, basswood,
and even white cedar will do. For a three foot kite, the California
redwood shake is very satisfactory. It is a kind of long shingle of
uniform thickness thruout, is six inches wide and three feet long. The
shake is split into strips about 7/16” or ½” wide, and bends sufficiently
for the bow. Some box factories will rip out spruce sticks in 25c.
bundles for boys at about one penny each. Some good sizes are
3/16” × ⅜” × 3’, ¼” × ½” × 4’ and ⅜” × ¾” × 5’. These should be straight grained
and well seasoned.</p>

<p>Sticks should be uniform in weight and bending qualities. Where
sticks are to be centered, careful measurements must be made, then by
balancing over a knife-blade the difference in weight can be detected
and the heavy end reduced by whittling off some. Some try to find
center by balancing, but this is very inaccurate; a string may be used
for measuring.</p>

<p>Aluminum tubing is used,
especially for parts of model aeroplanes,
but it is not available in
many places. Some make frames
of paper, but they are more for
curiosity than utility. For large
frames bamboo is excellent, but requires a different fastening of joints
than sawn out material, <a id="fig_1"></a><a href="#fig001">Fig. 1</a>. Split bamboo is excellent for curved outlines
and for light framework of butterflies and bird kites, and for Japanese,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Korean and Chinese kites. Wire can be used for frames of small
kites.</p>

<p><b>Lashing.</b> When two sticks are to be fastened together, instead
of nailing with a small brad, they should be lashed. First wind diagonally
around both sticks in both directions, <a id="fig_2"></a><a href="#fig002">Fig. 2</a>; then wind between
sticks around the other windings. This draws all the cord up tight,
<a id="fig_3"></a><a href="#fig003">Fig. 3</a>. Coat over with glue or shellac.</p>

<p>Large box-kite frames with
sawn out material should have the
upright posts let into the long
horizontal pieces a little, <a id="fig_4"></a><a href="#fig004">Fig. 4</a>. If
a brace is notched at the end to fit
over another piece, <a id="fig_5"></a><a href="#fig005">Fig. 5</a>, and is
liable to split out, it can be wound
just back of the notch with thread,
<a id="fig_6"></a><a href="#fig006">Fig. 6</a>, and coated with shellac. All windings should be neatly done
without criss-cross windings as in <a id="fig_7"></a><a href="#fig007">Fig. 7</a>. Which do you like best

<p><b>Collapsible Frames.</b> Folding frames can be made for most kites.
Large tailless kites have either a removable spine or bow, the square
box-kite has braces that spring into shallow notches, and the triangular
box and house kite combination can be rolled by having a removable
cross-stick. It is a great advantage to have folding kites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
<b>Stringing.</b> Symmetry is so necessary in the making of a good
kite, that the stringing becomes an important factor; for if two opposite
sides are made unequal, there will be more pressure on one side of
center than the other, the kite will be pulling off to one side or darting
down and perhaps will refuse to fly at all. A small hard twisted cotton
cord is good for stringing as it does not stretch.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>On kites where the string passes around the entire frame, <a id="fig_8"></a><a href="#fig008">Fig. 8</a>, it
is best to fasten at the end of one stick only, as at <i>a</i>, then pass in the
notches of the ends of the other sticks at <i>b</i>,
<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and tie again at <i>a</i>. We must assume
that the horizontal stick in <a href="#fig008">Fig. 8</a> has been
measured accurately for center as that is a
part of the framing process. The sticks can
be notched with a knife, <a id="fig_9"></a><a href="#fig009-010">Fig. 9</a>, or a saw-cut
can be made in the end, <a id="fig_10"></a><a href="#fig009-010">Fig. 10</a>. The
latter is less liable to split out, but the first
is more convenient, for every boy is likely
to have a knife or can borrow one.</p>

<div class="figright49">
 <a id="fig011"></a>
 <br>
 <img src="images/fig011.jpg"

<a href="#fig_11"><span class="goback">↑</span></a></span></p>
</div><!--end figright-->

<p>After the string is secured around the
entire figure, adjustment between points is
made. If a tailless kite is being strung up, the two upper portions are
shifted until the right and left sides are equal. The ends are then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
wound with another cord, <a id="fig_11"></a><a href="#fig011">Fig. 11</a>, to prevent slipping. The two lower
sides are then spaced and the lower end of the spine is secured in the
same way. Some may think it a waste of time to measure the lower
strings after the upper ones have been adjusted, but very often there is
quite a little difference, due to a springing of the spine. A six pointed
star kite would have six, instead of four spaces to even up. Some stringing
is used for inside designs, and some is used for strengthening frame.</p>

<p><b>Covering.</b> Probably more tissue paper is used in covering kites
than any other material. There are a number of kinds of tissue papers,
but the cheapest, because it is the cheapest, is used most. These cheap
tissue papers are now found in all shades and tints of colors.</p>

<p>The French tissues are more durable, and as a rule, more brilliant
in color. A kite covered with this paper can be used from time to time
without being disabled.</p>

<div class="figleft49">
 <a id="fig012"></a>
 <br>
 <img src="images/fig012.jpg"
 alt="Title or description">
 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>
 <a href="#fig_12"><span class="goback">↑</span></a></p>
</div><!--end figleft-->

<p>The Chinese tissue paper is the strongest of all tissues in one direction,
and should be used so as to bring the length way of the paper
in the direction of greatest strain. This paper only comes in a cream
color, but is very satisfactory where strength and hand color work are
desired. In Los Angeles we get two sheets for five cents, and the size
is 22” × 23”. There are some wrapping papers that are pliable and
strong enough to be used, especially on box-kites, but only a few of these
are of much service on plain surface
kites. The tight covering on
a box kite is an advantage. Some
boys use a paper that is commonly
known as a butter paper, and
others find orange wrapping paper
serviceable.</p>

<p>Of the cloth coverings, cambric
is the most popular. The sizing
is sufficient to keep the covering in shape during construction, it is light
in weight, comes in variety of good colors and is cheap. When cloth is
used on plain surface kites, care must be observed that the goods are
not used on the bias, as the unequal stretching would unbalance the poise
of the kite. Silk is excellent, but ——!! it isn’t used much by boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Most coverings are turned over the outer strings, and are pasted
or sewn down. In representative figure kites, the edge of the paper is
sometimes left free, while the string is made fast by extra strips of
paper pasted fast over the string and to the back of the cover, <a id="fig_12"></a><a href="#fig012">Fig. 12</a>,
thus leaving the edges to flutter in the breeze. Some large kites can
be covered with paper, if a network of string is used at the back to give
support to the covering.</p>

<p>Tailless, and some other kites require loose coverings, this looseness
should be planned for in a systematic manner. If the cover of a 3-foot
kite is placed on a table or the floor with the frame laid on top, the
edge of the cover may be cut one inch or one and one-half inches to the
outside of the string. Instead of turning in this whole amount, only
turn in one-half inch of the outer edge. This leaves plenty of looseness
for bagging of cover, and is regular.</p>

<h3>KITE ACCESSORIES</h3>


<p><b>The Bridle.</b> The kite is not supposed to be finished until the
bridle (or belly band) is attached. Nearly all kites require a bridle,
a very few have the kite line tied directly to some one point of the
framework. The bridle is a very important part of the kite equipment,
as the kite is dependent on it for the proper distribution of
pull by the kite line, it also gives the inclination of the exposed surface
to the breeze. The inclination is varied slightly for various purposes,
such as high flying, strong pulling, steady flying, etc. To make the
kite fly directly over head, the kite line is attached above the normal
point, and to make it fly low, the attachment should be below normal.
If the single line can be attached to the framework so as to give this
inclination, no bridle is needed but it is usually difficult to locate the
right point.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Many kites need attachment of bridle in but two places, while
others require three, some four, and some are benefited by the use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
many strings to the bridle, but the last may be used for strengthening
the framework of the kite more than for general poise. The Chinese
say there should never be more than three strings to the bridle, while
the Japanese use many.</p>

<p>The tailless kite may have the bridle attached at the bottom and
top of the spine (the vertical stick of the frame) or the bottom and at
the crossing of bow and spine. In either case the bridle must be long
enough so that when it is drawn over to the side of the kite, the loop
will just reach the outer points of the bow, <a id="fig_13"></a><a href="#fig013">Fig. 13</a>; <i>ac</i> should be the
same length as <i>ab</i>, and <i>cd</i> the same length as <i>bd</i>. The normal point
of attachment of kite line is at <i>c</i>, the point that just reaches <i>b</i> or <i>e</i>
when drawn to the side. Some bird kites have a similar bridle but
much shorter between attachments. More of the form kites have three
and four strings to the bridle. The three string bridle is usually two
strings above and a longer one below, <a id="fig_14"></a><a href="#fig014">Fig. 14</a>. The four string bridle
has two short uppers and two long lowers, <a id="fig_15"></a><a href="#fig015">Fig. 15</a>. For the poly string
bridle, see <a id="fig_16"></a><a href="#fig016">Fig. 16</a>. Some have advocated an elastic bridle but the
writer has never found it of any great advantage.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>A double bridle with a kite line to each, makes a dirigible kite
possible, which may be useful in a number of ways and which can give
much amusement in kite antics that is not possible with a single kite
line. A double bridle is illustrated in <a id="fig_17"></a><a href="#fig017">Fig. 17</a>. Such a kite can be
driven at will. The kite becomes a sail and can be pulled to right and
left, in circles and various contortions, out of the ordinary.</p>

<p><b>Kite Lines.</b> A three or four ply cotton wrapping string is used
more than any other and is very satisfactory for three-foot kites and
smaller. The hard twisted cotton seine twine comes from six to over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
a hundred ply, and is excellent for kite lines. It is strong and does not
burn the hands, nor kink as much as hemp twine.</p>

<p>For high flying or racing work, a light strong cord is necessary. A
small kite can carry up a great amount of silk or linen thread but one
should have a reel and gloves to handle it. Shoemakers thread and
upholstering twine are also used. Some think that waxing a string
makes it stronger, but by actual tests before and after waxing, there
was no appreciable difference in the amount of endurance of strain before
breaking. Waxing does preserve the string and prevents fraying and
untwisting.</p>

<p>When kites are put up in tandem, the string need only be as strong
for the first kite as is ordinarily used for one of its size, but as other
kites are added the size of the cord must be increased. This grading
of the string, greatly reduces the total weight and cost of the kite line.</p>

<p><b>Reels.</b> You can fish without a reel and you can fly
a kite without one, but the reel is a great convenience
and an absolute necessity at times for both. The reel
in brief is a large spool with flanges on both ends,
a central axle fixed to the spool, a frame for supporting
the axle, a guide for the string to prevent
its running off the reel, and a brake to prevent too
rapid unwinding when letting out the string. A reel
can be made without a crank, by having the axle
supported at one end only, and a knob handle fastened
to the outer face of the reel for winding purposes.
For further directions, see chapter on Reels.</p>

</div><!--end figleft-->

<p><b>Tails.</b> A tail and other balancers are used to
give poise to an otherwise unsteady kite. When a kite
is constructed in such a way as to present a broad flat
surface to the breeze, it will sway and dive and no
matter how carefully you attach your bridle it cannot
be supported in the air.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>For kites that represent irregular forms, there must also be a special
balancer. The tail is usually resorted to in such cases. The tail is more
than a weight. A foxy kite refuses to come to terms by the addition of a
thread and lead or other weight. The weight drops so quickly to its plumb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
line that the kite has not come to poise, and makes another pitch
in some other direction. The value of the tail depends not so much
on weight as on its pulling capacity while being drawn thru the
air. The tail, usually consisting of a string with a
number of pieces of paper folded and tied thereon,
<a id="fig_18"></a><a href="#fig018">Fig. 18</a>, and with cloth streamers at the end for
weight, exerts considerable pull for long enough
time to give steadiness to the kite. A kite must
have poise in the air just as we balance a board on
the end of a finger—if the finger is not centrally
located, the board will fall to the left or right,
front or back; so with the kite, if the pressure
of the air is not centrally located it will glide
to left or right, or pitch forward or tumble
backwards. The tail helps most in remedying the
two latter troubles. Almost any light surface can
be supported in the air by proper attachment of
bridle and tail. The Japanese use two or more tails
on their square kites consisting usually of long cotton
ropes with large tassels on the end. These look
very beautiful trailing out in long graceful parallel
lines.</p>

<p>Another form of air resistance found serviceable,
is hollow cones or funnel shaped devices of light
cardboard attached by cords to the kite in place of
tails, <a id="fig_19"></a><a href="#fig019-021">Fig. 19</a>.</p>

<p>A Chinese boy had a colored paper ball about
8” in diameter attached by a string to one of the
kites last year, <a href="#fig019-021">Fig. 20</a>. Another form is the intersected
cardboard discs, <a href="#fig019-021">Fig. 21</a>. Other forms can
be used.</p>

<p>Christmas and other paper rope used for decoration
purposes could be used to advantage for tails of
kites. They will catch the breeze and can be festooned into pretty designs
but will need cord supports to give strength.</p>

<p>Don’t throw away a kite because it has to have a tail. The tail is
sometimes the most beautiful part.</p>

<h3>KINDS OF KITES.</h3>


<p>Kites are so numerous in kinds and design nowadays that, in order
to get at any kind of intelligent discussion of them, it will be necessary
to segregate them into classes and varieties as the scientist does in his
investigations of nature study. There is the great big subject of constructive
sport called kite making. The name kite strikes joy to any
live boy’s heart and it does him good too. But kite making is too big,
so we will try running some cross-roads thru, thus dividing it into
smaller groups.</p>

<p>A large number of kites can be classed together as having the same
general make-up and we will call the first, Class A, Plain Surface
Kites. These kites have one general surface without any built out
parts, and can be subdivided into two divisions: 1. Geometric and
regular forms, 2. Irregular and representative forms.</p>

<p>There are two divisions of the geometric and regular forms:</p>


<ul><li>a. Tailless kites.</li>
<li>b. Kites with tails, regular in form.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two divisions of irregular forms are:</p>


<ul><li>a. Set pieces of design.</li>
<li>b. Insect, bird, animal, and man kites.</li>
</ul>

<p>This brings the analysis for Class A down to variety which will be
discussed in succeeding chapters.</p>

<p>Class B. Box-Kites, has six subdivisions:</p>


<ul><li>1. Square.</li>
<li>2. Rectangular.</li>
<li>3. Triangular.</li>
<li>4. Cylindrical.</li>
<li>5. Hexagonal.</li>
<li>6. Tetrahedral.</li>
</ul>

<p>Class C. Combined Kites. Box-kites may have additions of plain
surfaces, or combinations of curved surfaces and plain ones, giving
shapes that represent hollow forms of fish, animals, etc.</p>


<ul><li>1. Straight extensions of plain surfaces.</li>
<li>2. Hollow shapes representing animal and mechanical forms.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Class D. Kites in Series. These are made up of combined kites
also, but the combinations are so different that they belong in a class by
themselves.</p>


<ul><li>1. Compound kites.</li>
<li>2. Kites in tandem.</li>
<li class="isub1">a. Connected directly to one line.</li>
<li class="isub1">b. Connected by individual lines of some length to one main line.</li>
<li>3. Dragon Kites.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plain kites are the more numerous for several reasons. They
are more easily constructed, take less time, use less material, fly in
lighter breeze, and are usually more stable in air. The construction as
a rule consists of two or three sticks as a framework with a covering
stretched over it so as to form a simple plane that is exposed to the
breeze. Of course, there are tricks in making the plain kites, but almost
any of them can be made to fly by either warping the surface or attaching
a tail.</p>

<p>Box-kites require considerable time and are more difficult in construction.
They are a built up framework with cloth or strong paper
coverings. The frames must be kept light and strong, and a process
of trussing is necessary to accomplish this. The covering seldom covers
the whole framework but usually is made in bands. The space enclosed
by a band is called a cell. Most box-kites consist of a forward and rear
cell, that is a band is found at each end around the framework, transversely
to the length of the kite. Some of the most practical working
kites are of the box-kite type. By working kite, I mean kites that are
used for a purpose other than pleasure.</p>

<p>Some box-kites have extended wings of plain surfaces to gain more
lifting power, or for poise, and the application of these appendages
serves to explain the combination of kinds that form this group.</p>

<p>In the group “Kites in Series” we have kites of the same kind
fastened rigidly together making one kite, called a compound kite, also
kites fastened one after the other a few feet apart on one line and all
started up at one time, and still another set of similar kites in which
a number of kites are put up on individual strings, one at a time, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
perhaps 300 feet, and are then attached to the main kite line. Boys
sometimes succeed in pulling up as high as forty kites on one line by
this method. Another very interesting and beautiful series is the
Chinese dragon kite type. In this a number of kites are harnessed
together with about three cords running from head to tail.</p>

<p>These various groups will receive more explicit directions in separate
chapters as we proceed. So far in our analysis we have been dealing
with kinds of kites as to construction. There will be a number of
chapters on various other features of kite work and accessories, including,
Kite Decoration, Messengers, etc. The Chinese and Japanese
people have been making kites a great many years and have become
very skilful workers and decorators. Their decorations seem to tend
more toward the depicting of ugliness and fierceness instead of beauty
and color harmony, altho many of the color combinations are very
effective. The tendency toward fierceness can well be understood when
we consider that it has a part in their religion, it being supposed that
such ugly monsters helped to drive away the evil spirits.</p>

<p>The large Japanese square kite, which is rectangular in shape instead
of square, usually has a big head with plenty of the whites of the
eyes and teeth showing. Some very fine specimens have been exhibited
at our “Kite Tournaments”. They expend quite freely in making up
their kites, use costly ornaments and considerable gilt and black. The
gilt is usually very good that is used.</p>

<p>While the orientals have shown us some stunning effects in decoration,
I believe that the future will show some results of color harmony
and artistic spacing that will be much superior to theirs. We are
busy as yet trying to master the kite craft from the constructive and
flying side, but we are getting on, even on the decorative side as well.</p>

<p>We are now ready to discuss variety in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The tailless continues to be the most popular of all the kites. No
matter how artistic, how representative, how curious, or how mechanical
the new kites may be, the tailless is the first and last out every season.
It flies in a very light breeze, and is so steady in the air. There are
several kinds of tailless, but the two stick Eddy Kite seems to be the
winner. These kites are made from five inches to thirty feet in height.
This kite, Figs. <a href="#fig008">8</a> and <a id="fig_22"></a><a href="#fig022">22</a>, has two sticks of equal length, the vertical
stick is called the spine, and should be straight, while the bow is placed
about one-fifth the distance down from the top of the spine. This bow
stick is bent backward by inserting a brace stick as shown by <a id="fig_23"></a><a href="#fig023">Fig. 23</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
The advantage of a removable brace stick will be recognized when a
person tries to carry several kites to a field at one time. If the brace
stick is out, the kites lie flat and do not injure each other, so that
twenty-five or more might be carried by one person, but if the kite is
bowed, there may be great difficulty in carrying two or three. Most
boys bow about three inches for a three-foot kite. See <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter 1</a> for
the stringing of this kite.</p>

<p><b>The tailless kites</b> are nearly all constructed so as to have a keel
projecting out to the front. In order that the keel may be of more
service, the covering is not stretched tight, but is left loose. Perhaps an
inch along each side would be allowed for bagging or pocketing. See
Chapter I on covering. If the covering is drawn tight, the kite will
dodge and will probably dive to destruction.</p>

<p>Now we can modify this type form of kite. We can use two spines
and two bows, <a id="fig_24"></a><a href="#fig024">Fig. 24</a>. In this kite the upper bow should be bent more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
than the lower, and the bridle will be of more service if attached to the
upper bow at two points about midway from spine to end of bow. The
covering should not be quite so loose on this kite as on <a href="#fig022">Fig. 22</a> but should
not be tight. Another variation is given in <a id="fig_25"></a><a href="#fig025">Fig. 25</a>, in which two spines
are used and one bow. Sometimes the spines are crossed as shown in
<a id="fig_26"></a><a href="#fig026">Fig. 26</a>, the distance being much greater at the bottom than at the top
between the ends of the spine sticks. A modification of the last two is
shown in <a id="fig_27"></a><a href="#fig027">Fig. 27</a>, in which a built out keel is shown. Two small braces
project from the bottom of each spine with a third stick connecting
their meeting place with the center of the bow stick.</p>

<p>Still one other combination is a form that can be used as a foundation
for many outline shapes. It is shown in <a id="fig_28"></a><a href="#fig028">Fig. 28</a>, and has two
spines and two bows; but where much modification is made, a tail or
other balancers must be used. A kite with a broken bow is like a bird<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
with a broken wing, but if broken in the center it can be redeemed for
service by the addition of a cross-stick, as shown in <a id="fig_29"></a><a href="#fig029">Fig. 29</a>. The
broken part should be well lashed together. A kite could be successfully
planned in this way from the beginning. It is possible to make a
number of geometric or representative forms as tailless kites, but representative
forms as a rule need tails.</p>

<p>The shield, <a id="fig_30"></a><a href="#fig030">Fig. 30</a>, is one of the tailless kites and the writer
succeeded very well with a two bowed tailless in the shape of a six
pointed star. See <a id="fig_32"></a><a href="#fig032">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the largest group in real variation is that in which kites
with tails or other forms of balances are found. And first and foremost,
comes our grandfathers’ old English bow kite, <a href="#fig018">Fig. 18</a>, having a
bow that curves upward, but not backward, over the end of a single
spine. Tassels were added at each
side of the kite at the termination
of each end of the bow, and a long
tail of rolled papers tied to a string
with a cloth hanging at the end
was attached to the bottom of the
spine.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>The great class of star kites,
with varying numbers of points,
and the geometric, hexagonal, octagonal,
and other forms belong to
this group. A three string bridle
is most satisfactory for most of
these forms. The two upper
strings of bridle should be the
same length but shorter than the
lower string. The latter should
be attached at a central point at the bottom. In case there is no stick to
anchor to at the center of the bottom, four strings may be necessary or
two longer ones may be used at the bottom and one shorter one at the top.
However the bridle is attached, the shorter strings are always at the
top, and the single string must be centrally located to right and left,
whether at the top or bottom, and the double portions on equal distances
to each side of center line.</p>

<p>The bridle for a single spine and bow tailless is something attached
at top and bottom of spine, or at the intersection of bow and spine, and
at bottom of spine. In either case the bridle should be long enough
so that when stretched out to the side of the kite while attached at the
two points named, it will just reach out
to the end of the bow; and at this point
the kite line is attached; see <a href="#fig013">Fig. 13</a>. Fig.
33 shows a hexagonal kite. The same
framework could be covered as a star kite,
<a id="fig_34"></a><a href="#fig034">Fig. 34</a>. There may be any number of
points to a star kite, but most boys make
the six-pointed ones. Sometimes the
points are arranged as in <a id="fig_35"></a><a href="#fig035">Fig. 35</a>, and
again as in <a id="fig_33"></a><a href="#fig033">Fig. 33</a>. <a id="fig_36"></a><a href="#fig036">Fig. 36</a> shows a
very interesting tail for smaller star kites.
<a id="fig_37"></a><a href="#fig037">Fig. 37</a> has another arrangement of
stars for the tail. <a id="fig_38"></a><a href="#fig038">Fig. 38</a> shows a pentagonal
kite and its construction. The
bridle might be attached at one upper
point and the two lower points. Fig.
<a id="fig_39"></a><a href="#fig039">39</a> shows an addition to the six-pointed
star, in the shape of a crescent. Note
that two sticks are longer, extending
across the crescent, thus giving more
rigidity to the surface. The outline of
the crescent was made of split bamboo.
In a similar manner, a broad circle could
be formed about <a href="#fig038">Fig. 38</a>. See <a id="fig_38a"></a><a href="#fig038a">38a</a>.</p>

<p>Star and hexagonal kites are not the
only members of the regular shapes with
tails. The Japanese square kite, <a id="fig_40"></a><a href="#fig040">Fig.
40</a>, which is usually rectangular in shape,
has a vertical spine, two diagonal spines,
and several horizontal ribs that are lighter in weight than the spines. The
larger the kite, the more horizontal ribs will be required. By making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
removable spines the kites can be rolled up and the Japanese have
exhibited some very beautiful ones that have been imported. Some of
these cost as high as $30.00 or more. The two long ropelike tails
swinging in graceful, parallel curves give a beautiful effect to the
whole kite. The bridle is usually attached at many places on this kite.</p>

<p>Regular forms of kites are many. In <a id="fig_41-42"></a><a href="#fig041-042">Fig. 41</a> the circle is of reed

to <a href="#fig041-042">Fig. 41</a>. The balloon kite is another modification. The ship

<p>The irregular forms are more representative, and to many,
more interesting, because with patience and ingenuity almost any
form can be made to float in the air. Soaring birds, <a id="fig_46"></a><a href="#fig046">Fig. 46</a>, are
attractive and their construction is unique. Split bamboo is mostly
used for the framework. The Chinese boys take small strips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the Chinese tissue paper to lash the pieces of frame together. It
is very light and if twisted while wet, becomes tight and strong
when dry. The covering is also of Chinese tissue and colored with
a water color brush. A group of about five of these kites is very interesting
when soaring about on high. A pleasing modification is an ingenious
tail attachment that is hinged to the body so that the tail drops and is
raised again by the breeze, giving the appearance of fluttering when a
little distance away. <a id="fig_47"></a><a href="#fig047">Fig. 47</a> is a photograph of three that were flown at
one time and were mistaken by many for real birds, while <a id="fig_48"></a><a href="#fig048">Fig. 48</a> is a
photograph of a pair with fluttering tails. In each picture the back of
one bird is shown. In <a href="#fig047">Fig. 47</a> the birds are flat but in <a href="#fig048">Fig. 48</a> the bodies
are rounded out, giving a keel to the kite. This is done by making a light
framework of small split bamboo. Notice the little patches of paper
on the back that hold the string, allowing the edge of the covering to
float and flutter as feathers. The bridle attachment may be two strings,
as in <a href="#fig013">Fig. 13</a>, and may be three, as in <a href="#fig014">Fig. 14</a>. A set piece is shown
in <a id="fig_49"></a><a href="#fig049">Fig. 49</a>, with an American flag fluttering as a balancer. This makes
a very beautiful kite when enough time is put on it to make the bird
stand out clear and real in appearance. One boy cut papers and stuck
on to a background for feathers and while he succeeded well it is not
necessary and not as effective as a few good strokes with a water color
brush.</p>

<p>Butterflies offer a great variety in design and color, the best results
being obtained by pasting the striking colors over the general covering.
A more permanent kite can be made by using the Chinese tissue with
strong water colors, and it is more a work of art. A kite thirty inches
across, made of bamboo and Chinese paper will last for years if it has
good care. Butterfly kites have been made to fly without tails but
nearly all need one. Two drawings are shown, <a id="fig_50"></a><a href="#fig050">Fig. 50</a> shows the
double tail of ribbon and button of cardboard at bottom. The body
is curved like the bird form, <a href="#fig048">Fig. 48</a>, and the edge of the wing is
scalloped but the waves are longer than for feathers. A Chinese boy
made this and placed a small silk Chinese flag on one side of the
head and a like American flag on the other. The antennae were
pieces of small reed with silk balls that are sometimes used in ornamenting
draperies and gowns.</p>

medium thick cardboard. The
bridle can be attached from the
bear’s shoulders to the bottom of
the spine stick. The bridle is attached
only to the large bear.</p>

<p>A horse carrying a knight in
armor, or horses hitched to a chariot,
would take much planning but
are within reach. An elephant with
splendid equipment of royal hangings
would make a gorgeous appearance.
When difficult problems
of this kind are attempted it should
be by kite makers of experience as
much adjusting will be necessary,
and plans for framework will be
needed that will give rigidity and
lightness. Some parts in a complex
design will need stiffening with
reed bent out and around from the
framework. Sometimes a small
outline may be effected by means of
stiff paper and again a string may
be stretched from some distant stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of the framework so as to carry the covering out to certain lines. By
careful planning some very complicated forms can be worked out. In
the mounted knight, <a id="fig_53"></a><a href="#fig053">Fig. 53</a>, the nose of the horse will be a straight
stick, but the upper line of neck and lower part of head will be bent
reed, and of good weight. The
raised knee and foot are reed, while
the under side of neck changes
from the line of the breast by
means of a string. The back of
the foreleg on the ground is of
string, while the extension of the
stirrup might be of stiff paper.
Much can be done with the brush.
For instance, the dropping down
of the rump to the tail would be
curved, let the outline run angular, then with a heavy streak of color,
give form. A little silver paper on the armor will spice it up wonderfully.</p>

<p>We might consider a mechanical model, an electric coupe, <a id="fig_54"></a><a href="#fig054">Fig. 54</a>.
The tires may be somewhat exaggerated and stationary, while the inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
spokes and hub could be in the form of a small windmill so as to
turn around, giving the effect of running. In such case, the fans should
be so turned as to turn the wheels in the same direction. By the use of
a double bridle and two kite lines, it would be possible to cause the
auto to travel across the sky. Electric cars and locomotives might be
similarly made and manipulated.</p>

<p>When reed or bamboo are to be bent for some very particular form,
it might be well to lay it out on a board with brads on each side, leaving
it to dry. In this way a truer form may be secured. Bamboo can be
bent into shape by a little heating over a flame.</p>

<p>The human kite has all the possibilities of caricature in it, and there
are some very funny attempts. “Just Boy,” <a id="fig_55"></a><a href="#fig055">Fig. 55</a>, is a good one, and
“Foxy Grandpa” is popular. <a id="fig_56"></a><a href="#fig056">Fig. 56</a> is the “Squared Chinaman”. The
“Clown and Donkey,” <a id="fig_57"></a><a href="#fig057">Fig. 57</a>, is rather easy, being a combination of
three tailless kites. The “Dutch Girl” makes a good kite, also “Me
Happy,” <a id="fig_58"></a><a href="#fig058">Fig. 58</a>. In these as in the previous sub-group, much of the
effect is dependent on skilful handling of brush, after the kite has been
constructed. The flying depends much on the attachment of bridle and
balancers.</p>

<h3>BOX-KITES.</h3>

<p><b>Box-kites</b> were a new invention a very few years ago. People said,
“No use trying to put a drygoods box up in the air,” and yet something
very similar in shape has been successfully used for a number of
practical purposes. The box-kites usually require more breeze than
the plain surface kites, but are stronger pullers, which means also
heavier lifters than their lighter breeze cousins. Before entering the
discussion of box-kites, it will be well to understand some terms that
are used quite generally by all kite enthusiasts. <a id="fig_59"></a><a href="#fig059">Fig. 59</a> is a plain two-celled
box-kite; <i>a</i>, is the length of the kite. The framework consists
of four sticks, one at each corner, and four braces, two near each end
of the kite, placed diagonally across the inside of the kite from one
corner stick to the other. The covering consists of two bands passing
on the outside of the four corner sticks, one band at each end.</p>

<p>The band and space enclosed is called a cell of the kite. So this kite
has two cells. The length of the cell is the same as the width of the
kite and is represented by <i>b</i>; the depth of the cell is the same as the
height of the kite in its present position, and is shown by letter <i>e</i>; the
breadth of the cell by letter <i>d</i>; and the distance between cells, <i>c</i>, is called
the vent. Nearly all box-kites require the vent, and the vent is usually
wider than the breadth of the cell. Usually the two cells, the fore and
aft, are the same size, but not necessarily so. No one would be seen
flying a box-kite with any kind of tail unless that had a purpose in
carrying out the design. The square box-kite, <a id="fig_60"></a><a href="#fig060">Fig. 60</a>, is square in
cross-section, is very serviceable for flying, and is convenient for carrying.
It is usually made to fold up, and the bridle is attached to one
corner piece of the frame. This kite flies diagonally in the air. It is
quite easy to attach the bridle to two corner sticks of the frame, when
it flies horizontally, <a id="fig_61"></a><a href="#fig061">Fig. 61</a>. Lining cambric is good for covering and
some bright color should be used; but some prefer a good wrapping
paper. Chinese tissue may be used if the kite is not too large. The
corner sticks stand diagonally in the corners of the kite so that the
notches of the braces can fit over them, see <a id="fig_62"></a><a href="#fig062">Fig. 62</a>. The drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
represents the end of the kite, with the corner sticks stretched apart.
<a id="fig_63"></a><a href="#fig063">Fig. 63</a> represents a part of one of the braces. String and glue are
used back of the notch to prevent splitting when the strain is put on
them up in the air. The braces are made just a little long so that they
bow a little when in place, and this stretches the cover tight.</p>

<p>A word about getting the cover on the corner sticks may be in order.
The distance around the kite is determined, and a band is made the
right width and the right length to reach around when the braces are
sprung to place. Stretch the band out like a rubber band, <a id="fig_64-65"></a><a href="#fig064-065">Fig. 64</a>, and
put in two corner sticks at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> that have previously been glued on
one edge, and allowed to partially dry until it is what is called tacky.
Now the band at the other end should also be glued in place when the
progress will show as in <a href="#fig064-065">Fig. 65</a>. Remember the glue is only on the
outer edge of the sticks. Now find and mark the exact center between
the sticks glued in place and fold to these two lines, and glue in the other
two sticks in a similar manner. The progress made will be as shown
in <a id="fig_66"></a><a href="#fig066">Fig. 66</a>. When the glue is thoroly dry, the kite is ready for the
braces and for flying. The braces might be tied together where they
cross each other. A good size for the corner sticks is 3/16” × ½” × 36” with
bands 10” wide and 64” long, plus 1” additional for the hem. This
will give 16” for each side. Enough will be needed additional in
width so as to allow a ½” hem for each side. Each band then will
require a strip of cloth or paper 11” wide and 65” long. With paper
bands the ½” should be folded over and a string should be glued inside
to strengthen the edge. The braces should be ⅛” × ½” × 21⅞” from the
bottom of one notch to the bottom of the other, see <a href="#fig062">Fig. 62</a>.</p>

<p><b>Rectangular Kite.</b> The next is the rectangular kite, as shown in
<a id="fig_67"></a><a href="#fig067">Fig. 67</a>. This is a splendid kite of its kind and should have specific
measurements. The two center pieces called the spines are ⅝” × ⅝” the
corner and cross-pieces ⅜” × ⅜”. The bands for cells are 21” wide by 18”,
with 1” additional for the seam. The edges should be hemmed as in
previous kite. The framework should be all thoroly wired in every
direction as shown by drawing, <a id="fig_68"></a><a href="#fig068">Fig. 68</a>. Little wire turnbuckles such
as are sold by firms carrying model aeroplane supplies might be used,
and the stretch of the wires could be taken up from time to time. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
well made kite will last a long time if it has good care. This particular
construction is for large kites and they are not often made to fold,
altho it is possible to make them so. Out of the box-kite has grown the
aeroplane. Some good sizes for kites are:</p>

<div class="indent5">

<p class="hanging">Six-foot kite:—6’ long, 6’ wide, 3’ deep, 1’9” width of cell,
⅝” × ⅝” corner-pieces, 2’6” between cells, ⅝” × ⅝” spines.</p>

<p class="hanging">Nine-foot kite:—9’ long, 9’ wide, 4’ deep, 2’6” width of cell,
¾” × ¾” corner-pieces, 4’ between cells, 1” × 1” spines.</p>

<p class="hanging">Twelve-foot kite:—12’ long, 12’ wide, 6’ deep, 3’6” width of
cell, ⅞” × ⅞” corner pieces, 5’ between cells, 1¼” × 1¼” spines.</p>

<p>The two kites just described may be modified in a number of ways
as follows:—Two square kites side by side will give <a id="fig_69"></a><a href="#fig069-070">Fig. 69</a>, and three
side by side <a href="#fig069-070">Fig. 70</a>; these might be increased in both directions until a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
kite like <a id="fig_71"></a><a href="#fig071">Fig. 71</a> might be evolved. But there is no great gain and much
hindrance in some of these complications. If there is insufficient room
between upper and lower surface, not all of the surface is exposed and
there is skin friction, again if there is not space enough between the
fore and back cells, the front cuts off the air pressure to some extent
on the back cells. So <a id="fig_72"></a><a href="#fig072-073">Fig. 72</a> is not high enough, while <a href="#fig072-073">Fig. 73</a> has the
fore and back cells too close together. <a id="fig_74"></a><a href="#fig074">Fig. 74</a> is very unstable in the air.</p>

<p>The triangular cross-section has the advantage of a bracing framework
and is easy in combination. The bridle is attached to one of the
long sticks and the kite rides on a keel, <a id="fig_75"></a><a href="#fig075">Fig. 75</a>. Three braces about
the middle of each cell keep the corner sticks out to place. These can
be put in at the field, thus allowing the kite to be rolled for transportation.
The triangular kite is sometimes lengthened so as to use three
cells, <a id="fig_76"></a><a href="#fig076">Fig. 76</a>, and again two kites are placed side by side, <a id="fig_77"></a><a href="#fig077">Fig. 77</a>, and
this may be increased by placing another below both, as in <a id="fig_78"></a><a href="#fig078">Fig. 78</a>. In
the last combination we have a large kite to the outside and a smaller
one to the inside which can be lengthened so as to give three cells in
length, <a id="fig_79"></a><a href="#fig079">Fig. 79</a>, and many other combinations can be made.</p>

<p><b>Tetrahedral Kite.</b> Out of the triangular has grown the celebrated
Bell tetrahedral kites, which can be increased in size beyond that of any
other kite. No attempt will be made to give an exhaustive description
or full construction of these wonderful kites as Dr. Bell has written
a number of good articles on the subject for the <i>Scientific American</i> and
other magazines. There have been some wonderful kites made on this
principle of construction. In simple kites of this construction we have
a large tetrahedral frame composed of six sticks, <a id="fig_80"></a><a href="#fig080">Fig. 80</a>. Owing to
the bracing effect, remarkably small material can be used. For a kite
four feet to an edge, 3/16” sticks were ample. All of the drawings given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
here represent the kite resting on its keel, tho a kite left in that
position would topple over unless supported in some way. Now we
will divide this large tetrahedral horizontally by four sticks, <a id="fig_81"></a><a href="#fig081">Fig. 81</a>,
and in <a id="fig_82"></a><a href="#fig082">Fig. 82</a> strings are run from the ends of the four horizontal
sticks to the middle of the keel, also to the middle of the upper ridge
stick. Some use sticks in place of the strings, but if the kite is not
too large the strings are as good and in small kites better. <a id="fig_83"></a><a href="#fig083">Fig.
83</a> shows a four-celled tetrahedral with the coverings on. <a id="fig_84"></a><a href="#fig084">Fig. 84</a>
shows a further division in which each cell of <a href="#fig083">Fig. 83</a> is again divided
into four cells, making a 16-celled kite. The kite rides in
the air tipped as shown in <a id="fig_85"></a><a href="#fig085">Fig. 85</a>. Look up some of the articles
given in the “Bibliography of Kites” for further discussions of this type.</p>

<p>The hexagonal kite is also an outgrowth of the triangular. Looking
at the end of a hexagonal kite, three brace sticks will be seen, <a id="fig_86"></a><a href="#fig086">Fig. 86</a>,
which can be made removable, thus allowing the kite and its covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to be rolled. The kite will be more stable in the air if one side is down,
so the bridle will be attached to two of the long sticks, and if it proves
unmanageable, at four points.</p>

<p>The circular cross-sectioned or
barrel kite is more of a curiosity.
It has two cells, and the frame is
made up of four circles, either of
split bamboo, reed, or thin tough
wood. The circle should be shaped
before further construction is attempted.
Most of the strain will
come on the circles so the ribs,
connecting the four circles, may be
quite light and slender. There will
be less danger of twisting out of
shape if more than two ribs are
used. The ribs should be lashed
to the rings with thread or twisted
paper. No braces are necessary in
the small ones; a long stick slanting
thru the entire kite may be
used in the larger ones, see <a id="fig_87"></a><a href="#fig087">Fig. 87</a>,
with covering.</p>

<p>A pentagonal frame could be
constructed with three braces,<a id="fig_88"></a><a href="#fig088"> Fig.
88</a>, and should be flown in the
position shown.</p>

<p><b>Straight Extension of Surfaces.</b> One of the most efficient and
popular kites in the combined construction group is the two spined tailless,
called the house kite, and the triangular box-kite, as shown by  <a id="fig_90"></a><a href="#fig089">Fig.
89</a>. This is an easy kite to make and the proportions are easy to
remember. The simplest plan is shown in <a href="#fig090">Fig. 90</a>. Three sticks of the
same size are used; say, ⅜” × ½” × 4½’. The horizontal stick is lashed to
the two vertical spines down one-third the distance from the top, in this
case 18”. The two spines are also 18” apart, which leaves the extension
of the horizontal 18” to each side of spines. Now run a string around
the outside of the framework, and cover as in <a id="fig_91"></a><a href="#fig091">Fig. 91</a>. The two cells
are now built over the two spaces between the spines. There need not
be any braces for these cells, but another stick of the same dimensions
as the other three is used to keep the keel shaped portion in place when
pulled out by the breeze. The whole framework can be built rigid,
using two short braces about
the middle of each cell out to
the fourth stick or keel of
kite; the best way, however,
is to make the horizontal
stick removable and without
the short braces so that the
kite may be rolled up. Remember
there are only four
sticks in such a kite and they
are all the same size. This
kite is sometimes called the
“Coyne Kite,” again the “French War Kite,” and is a steady flyer and a
strong puller. The bridle can be adjusted so as to give much or little inclination
to the breeze. For lazy, easy gliding, the kite would be adjusted <a id="chg1"></a>as in
<a id="fig_92"></a><a href="#fig092">Fig. 92</a>, or with the lower horizontal shorter, as in <a id="fig_93"></a><a href="#fig093">Fig. 93</a>. The horizontals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
may be bowed forward and also backward. We have had all sizes of
this kite at the tournaments. <a id="fig_94"></a><a href="#fig094">Fig. 94</a> is about five inches tall, while
another was sixteen feet tall and required quite an army of boys to pull
it up in the air.</p>

<p>A similar combination can be made with the square box-kite on the
diagonal with straight surfaces out to each side, as shown in <a id="fig_95"></a><a href="#fig095">Fig. 95</a>.
Besides the four vertical sticks, there are four horizontal pieces of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
so as to be nearer horizontal. This kite can be modified by a lower horizontal
two-thirds down of the same length as the upper horizontal, as in
same length and one short brace placed centrally in each cell to keep
the fore and back sticks apart. The short braces can be notched to slip
into place and on being removed will let the kite down flat. This
kite will need to be more rigid than the one just described. A hexagonal
box-kite could be made with side wings by extending one of the braces
at each end, <a id="fig_96"></a><a href="#fig096">Fig. 96</a>, and the pentagonal form could be similarly
modified. <a id="fig_97"></a><a href="#fig097">Fig. 97</a> has a little different plan of extension that looks
more like wings. A triangular box-kite is used as the main structure
to build on. Three long sticks are required with four short braces on
each side, eight in all, with eight wing sticks, four
long and four shorter, that are attached to an inner
long stick of the box-like portion and extend across
to the short brace of the opposite side. When a pair
of the extension sticks are fastened to place, they are
lashed together at their crossing point. The slanting
extensions are strongly built and add poise to
the kite.</p>

</div><!--end figleft-->

<p>The poise of a rectangular kite may be increased
by the addition of slant extensions. The extension
pieces start from the lower corner pieces, pass under
the upper corner pieces, lashing fast at both places,
<a id="fig_98"></a><a href="#fig098">Fig. 98</a>. If a little variety in outline is desired, split
bamboo or reed could be used to make such forms as
are desired; even string connections can be made.</p>

<p>In making hollow form objects both patience and
skill are necessary. A form that is interesting but
not representative of any real object is shown in
<a id="fig_99"></a><a href="#fig099">Fig. 99</a>. Another is the arrow kite, <a id="fig_100"></a><a href="#fig100">Fig. 100</a>. The
flying bird kite should make a good problem for
some ingenious chap. The framework and stringing
is shown in <a id="fig_101"></a><a href="#fig101">Fig. 101</a>. The cross-section of the body of the bird is
about the shape of a tailless kite. The plan gives such good bracing
construction that very light material may be used. Four feet would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
a good length for this kite. The soaring bird, <a id="fig_102"></a><a href="#fig102">Fig. 102</a>, is quite similar
in construction to the preceding kite. The body is never square in
cross-section. A little bow is given to the tip ends of the wings. The
back line of the wing changes by
means of an extra cord. This
kite is not as stable as “The flying
Bird.”</p>

<p>The “flying fish,” <a id="fig_103"></a><a href="#fig103">Fig. 103</a>,
needs vents, as the whole body is
a box-kite. Two views of the
framework are given; a center
spine runs the entire length of the fish with two curves at the mouth.
The mouth is left open, so string is used for the outline. The original
kite was very mechanically made. It was beyond amateur work and
showed that some skilled workman had assisted. Much can be done with
the brush to make this a very interesting kite. Scales can be painted and
the fins and tail lined up. Wherever vents are placed, there should be
a string for the edge of the paper to turn over, or it will tear out.</p>

<p>The “Clown and Donkey,” <a href="#fig057">Fig. 57</a>, is the combination of three
tailless kites, and is what is known as a compound kite. <a id="fig_104"></a><a href="#fig104">Fig. 104</a> is
another example of compounding. <a id="fig_105"></a><a href="#fig105">Fig. 105</a> shows a star kite compounded
together.</p>

<p><b>Kites in Series.</b> A boy may put up a kite about five hundred feet,
and if it is a good flyer, tie the kite line fast and put up another on
perhaps three hundred feet of string. If the second is also a steady
flyer he can tie the end of that kite line to the first and let out perhaps
three hundred feet more of the first line, and again tie it fast.
Another kite is added in the same manner as the second and so on.
The best flyers of the series should be placed as leaders. Boys have
put up as high as forty kites in such a series, and no one has any
idea of the beauty of such a series, when looking up from the standpoint
of the flyer, until he has actually seen such a combination.
Some prefer to take a color scheme and use it for all the kites,
others prefer a great variety of colors, and it is hard to tell which
is the most pleasing. Tailless kites are used more than any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
for such purposes. <a id="fig_106"></a><a href="#fig106">Fig. 106</a> shows the arrangement. This is one
of the best schemes for high flying. The first kite should not be put
out to the limit of its lifting power else when the rest of the string
is lifted it will not mount up higher. It should have considerable
reserve when the second kite is attached. For high flying, the kites
should be placed farther apart, and the first part of the line should
be light and strong and the thickness increased as needed for strength
of the combined kites. Kites can be put up to a great height in this
way. This way of combining kites is called “Kites in Tandem.”</p>

Another way of flying kites in tandem is to fasten all kites directly
to the one kite line, the line passing thru each kite after the
first. This method however requires a helper for each kite and
they are placed closer together. At one of the Los Angeles Tournaments,
two boys had a beautiful team of green and white kites
arranged in the second series of tandem. The kites were of the triangular
box and house kite order, <a id="fig_89"></a><a href="#fig089">Fig. 89</a>, were six feet and nine
feet tall, and were nine in number. There was insufficient breeze to
fly them well, but it was great sport for thirty or forty boys to run
with the kite line. They were strong enough to lift up a large
man. The heaviest pull that was registered was a little over two
hundred pounds, but in a good breeze they would have pulled over
four hundred. I would like to show you a picture of them, but I
failed to get one.</p>

<p>In the second series of tandems, while all kites are attached to
the same line directly, there is an individual bridle for each kite, but
in the third series we have a sort of harness that combines all kites
together, so that if one tips forward, all tip forward, and vice versa.
It will be seen that in <a id="fig_107"></a><a href="#fig107">Figs. 107</a> and <a id="fig_108"></a><a href="#fig108">108</a> where a number of tailless
kites are arranged in a regular series, that there is a complete harness
running from the larger kite as a head, to the banner floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
out at the rear. Four cords are attached, one at the top, another
at the bottom, and one at each side. The distances between all points
are the same, so when the head tips forward, the second kite has a
similar inclination to the breeze, and so on thruout the whole series.
The bridle is attached at the four points at the head, so attached as
to give a good flying inclination. This series is called a “Tailless
Dragon Kite” and flies well and makes a fine appearance in the air.
The tailless dragon can be made more ornamental and seem more
connected, by extending the spine above the kite as in the head, a string
with a feather edge of tissue paper being festooned from the top of one
kite in the series to the next. At the bottom of each kite some streamers
of tissue paper would help in the same manner, <a id="fig_109"></a><a href="#fig109">Fig. 109</a>. The regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Chinese centipede kite, <a id="fig_110"></a><a href="#fig110">Fig. 110</a>, is not so difficult now that we have

<p>The Chinese say there should never be more than three strings to
bridle or harness; this bridle has two strings to the head of the dragon,
and three strings to the harness. The harness consists of the
three strings running from one
end of the kite to the other. The
Chinese dragon kite usually, if not
always, has circular disks for the
body of the monster. <a id="fig_111"></a><a href="#fig111">Fig. 111</a>
shows a beautiful kite hung on the
wall for decorative purposes and
shows the design on the individual
sections, while <a id="fig_112"></a><a href="#fig112">Fig. 112</a> shows the
same kite held by boys on the lawn.
The lighter portion on the disk is
green with gilt scales, while the
darker portion is scarlet. The head
is all colors, with red mouth, white
teeth, eyes that revolve with little mirrors thereon to flash the sunlight.
The framework for the head is shown in <a id="fig_113"></a><a href="#fig113">Fig. 113</a>. While the
framework for each circular disk, <a id="fig_114"></a><a href="#fig114">Fig. 114</a>, is just a band of bamboo,
with a light strip of bamboo to which the peacock feathers are attached
as balancers, the disks are covered
with Chinese paper and decorated.
The disks are 10” and the balancer
sticks 30”. The feathers are
lashed to the balancer sticks. The
discs are 12” apart. The last disc
has streamers of ribbon or tissue
paper. This kite flies well and sways about like an immense brightly
colored caterpillar up in the air.</p>

balancers, tufts of tissue paper were used. A special balancer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
used for the whole kite in the form of a hollow ball. Small reed or
bamboo was used for the skeleton, and this was covered with tissue
paper. See it hanging below the kite’s head in the picture. The various
sections are covered with different colored papers. The heads differ,
but otherwise the kites are quite similar in construction.</p>

<h3>DECORATION OF KITES.</h3>


<p>Kites may be decorated in three general ways. Piece work in covering;
overlaying, called aplaca; and brush work. The decoration of
kites presents some unique problems. The great distances at which
the decorations are to be seen force a study of the carrying qualities of
colors.</p>

<div class="figright49">
 <a id="fig116"></a>

 <a href="#fig_116"><span class="goback">↑</span></a></p>
</div><!--end figright-->

<p>The star kite is probably the best for decoration, as the spacing
falls in easier relationships than some of the other forms. In the kite
shown in <a id="fig_116"></a><a href="#fig116">Fig. 116</a> the covering is applied so as to give a decorative
effect, and it showed up splendidly in the air. The colors did not
stand out as well as might be expected, however, and while high in
the air it was nearly overlooked by the judges. When brought nearer
it received the first prize. Another way of combining colors is to
make one half one color and the
other half another, giving a light
and shade effect to each point, <a id="fig_117"></a><a href="#fig117">Fig.
117</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#fig037">Fig. 37</a> shows a pleasing arrangement
of spaces. The kite is
first covered with the body color,
then the bandings are put on, and
lastly the spots. A banding around
the outside of the stars in the tail
is effective and in keeping. Passe-partout
is excellent for banding in
some places.</p>

<p>The five-pointed star kite, <a href="#fig038">Fig.
38</a>, is neat and artistic. The
framework is given to the
left.</p>

<p><b>The Six-pointed Star</b>, <a id="fig_118"></a><a href="#fig118">Fig. 118</a>, has interesting spaces and paths.
The wide paths running to the center are divided by passe-partout.
The discs at the points are in keeping with the large one at the center.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
The main cover was in two tones of grey green. The one spine and

<p>The Japanese square kite, <a id="fig_126"></a><a href="#fig126">Fig. 126</a>, is like a canvas, ready for a
grotesque figure, a beautiful landscape, or a conventional design, and
many of these have been very artistically decorated.</p>

<p>For box-kites with bands as a part of their construction, the banding
designs seem more consistent, and so are used more. See Figs.

<p>Some very satisfactory results are obtained by using good colors, say
blue and black, relieved with gilt. Red and white makes a pleasing
combination, also red and black. A circle divided into three parts
presents a little problem in color harmony analysis. There are three
primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. We may use blue in a color
scheme. Combining the other two colors, red and yellow, we get
orange. Orange is called the complement of blue, but orange is too
strong, and a better color harmony is formed by the addition of some
of the third color, the blue to the orange, which will give a brown.
Now brown and blue make a better color harmony than orange and
blue. So it runs, two primary colors give a secondary, but the colors
are more pleasing when subdued with the third color or by the addition
of grey or white. Red and olive will need dividing paths of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
strong color, black or white. When gilt is used it must be edged with
black or some very dark color or it loses its effectiveness. While
orange is too strong for combination with blue, it is good with black.
When yellow is used with the purples it should be a modest yellow.</p>

<p>Just as in landscape where the highlights are warm colors, we
seek a cool color for shadows, and vice versa, so with color combination
we strike across the color circle and choose a warm and cool color for
balance. Some of the analogous hues are very pleasing, but unless
quite a little variation of color is used, the design soon loses out in the
distance. Browns, greens, reds, blues, etc., may be used in their individual
color schemes, but the throwing in of some opposite color has
a spicing up effect that is helpful. A dark brown, medium brown, a
dull yellow, and a light but not brilliant yellow, give a good combination.
Some color schemes that are very beautiful for rugs and interior
decoration do not carry far enough to be used on a kite. Some
very brilliant colors that might shock us close by, are charming when
far up in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
But this is not a treatise on color work, and the subject is so great,
that we must leave it here. Sometimes striped effects are made with
gummed papers similar to passe-partout. The little mirrors mentioned
are such as are used on gowns and draperies. They are set in little
rims of light brass and with a good allowance of paste may be stuck
sufficiently well to any portion of the kite to hold during a tournament.
The mirrors might be found at Chinese stores. Whirling devices,
to be treated in a following chapter, may also be used for ornamentation.
Tassels, streamers, and banners all serve a purpose of artistic
makeup when properly used.</p>

<p>All are more or less familiar with the piece of paper with a hole in
it that is slipped over the string of a kite high in the air. The wind
catches it and whirls it along, until it finally reaches its destination,
the kite. Sometimes urgent business demands several communications
to the kite, so several pieces of paper are seen whirling at various
distances from the boy, making their way, now slowly, now faster, overtaking,
falling behind and so on until they fulfill their mission. Such is
the usual kite messenger.</p>

<p><b>A clever little messenger</b> was described by Nungent in <i>St.
Nicholas,</i> for October, 1900. This has been modified and used at a
number of kite tournaments. It is in the form of a little yacht, and
has a beam on which is attached two pulleys under which the kite
line runs, a mast that carries the sail and that also extends downward
thru the hull to carry a weight that holds the yacht upright. The
mast slants backward a little so as to brace against the pull of the
sail. The sail is held up by a string that is attached to an easy trip,
and when released the sail drops and the yacht returns down the kite
line to the operator by gravity. <a id="fig_138"></a><a href="#fig138">Fig. 138</a>
shows a complete model with sail up as
it appears on the up trip. <a id="fig_139"></a><a href="#fig139">Fig. 139</a>
shows the various parts: the beam, <i>a</i>, is
made of a light wood, ¼” × ½” × 15”, portions
are cut away to reduce weight;
the mast <i>b</i>, is round, ¼” in diameter
at bottom, tapering to a point at the top,
is 29½” long, 9” below the beam and 20”
above; the mast is lashed to the side
of the beam; <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are yard arms,
<i>c</i> being 16” and <i>d</i> 14” long and both about ⅛” to 3/16” thru;
<i>c</i> is lashed above the beam, and <i>d</i> is hung by a thread 15”
higher up. A thread is run from each end of both yard arms to
the top of the metal loop supporting the back pulley wheel. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
threads are for the purpose of preventing twisting of the sail. The
sail is of some light soft material that is very pliable in the breeze.
Some use silk, others soft cotton, and some paper. I used a Chinese
tissue paper sail and found it very satisfactory; it lasted several seasons.
The strong way of the paper should be put on up and down.
The sail is pasted or sewed to the yard arms. The sail line is a
piece of linen thread that is fastened to the middle of the upper yard
arm, passing thru a loop made of small wire, <i>u</i>, which is lashed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the mast, see <a id="fig_140"></a><a href="#fig140">Fig. 140</a>. The line then passes to the eye of the wire
forming the trip on the side of the beam, see <a id="fig_141"></a><a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a>. <i>t</i> is a small
nail in the side of the beam <i>a</i>; <i>m</i> is a long slim wire nail with an
eye bent at the top and two bends at right angles about half way
down. A piece of small spring brass wire will do as well as the
slim nail. A small round wooden stick, <i>e</i>, not larger than ⅛” at the
largest end and about 14” long lies loosely in the screw-eyes, <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>,
under the beam. The end of the hook that the sail line is fastened to
passes down thru a small hole in the end of the small stick <i>e</i>. A
weight, <i>p</i>, is secured to the lower end of the mast to prevent overturning
of the yacht, and a piece of light cardboard is used for the
hull.</p>

<p><b>The pulley wheels</b> can be turned on a lathe or small metal ones,
especially aluminum can be used. Strips of tin make good frames for
the wheels, and are attached to both sides of the beams. If wooden
wheels are used, care should be taken to see that the holes are in the
center. Wire nails make good axles. The kite line is liable to jump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
out the grooves of the wheels, so small screw-eyes placed in the beam
just in front and behind each wheel will keep the kite line in place.
It may be an advantage to press the eye together some so as to make
an elongated hole, <a id="fig_142"></a><a href="#fig142">Fig. 142</a>. Some care will be necessary to see that
the screw-eyes are screwed in just the right distance so as to prevent
the string from resting on the screw-eyes instead of the grooved wheels.</p>

<p><b>The Release.</b> The sail is tripped by the stick, <i>e</i>, being pushed
against an obstruction of cardboard fastened perhaps three hundred
feet from the kite, see <a id="fig_143"></a><a href="#fig143">Fig. 143</a>. The reason for placing it away
from the kite is that when the weight comes on the kite line, the last
part of the trip is very steep; by placing the obstruction some distance
from the kite this difficulty is largely overcome.</p>

<p>As a final warning, the sail line should just be tight enough to
hold the sail in place while going up and not tight enough to prevent
easy tripping when <i>e</i> touches the obstruction disk. Some put on elastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
bands to pull the sail down quickly when it is tripped. The nearer
the sail can float out straight behind on the return trip, the less resistance
there will be to the breeze. Some even go so far as to have
a little rolling up device for the sail. A thread should be attached
to the beam and to the little rod <i>e</i> to prevent its falling out on the
down trip.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Japanese sometimes have little messengers that
are released when a punk burns down so as to burn off a supporting
thread. This might be applied to parachutes too. Another good device
but which is not self-propelling on the upward trip is the trolley
car, <a id="fig_144"></a><a href="#fig144">Fig. 144</a>. The car is pulled up the kite line to a trip, when it is
released and returns by gravity. The pulley block is tied into the
kite line, <a id="fig_145"></a><a href="#fig145">Fig. 145</a>. The line below the block passes thru the car under
a little roller on the inside of the car at each end. The car can be
made up of any light material, but need not be as light as self propelled
devices, the weight being an advantage on the downward run. The
line that pulls the car up passes around the grooved pulley, thru the
guides in the pulley block and one end goes to the car while the other
goes to the operator. A release is necessary, and perhaps a little sharp
blade like a safety razor blade will be as effective as any, <a id="fig_146"></a><a href="#fig146">Fig. 146</a>.
In <a id="fig_147"></a><a href="#fig147">Fig. 147</a> another trip is shown in which a wire is bent, as at <i>a</i>.
This wire passes up thru the upper portion of the roof at <i>b</i>, and passes
thru screw-eyes <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>; <i>d</i> is bent forward. The lower portion of
the wire as represented is much longer than the upper, and when it
touches the pulley block is pushed back, and the shorter portion is pushed
back of screw-eye <i>d</i>, which releases the small ring, <i>e</i>, to which the pulling
line to the operator is attached, and also sets free the car to run down
the kite line. This last is not a difficult attachment and seems a little
more scientifically mechanical.</p>

<p>There are other ways of effecting the release. A good pulling
kite is necessary, as in the excitement of pulling up the car, more
strain is put on the kite than one would realize. If a race is on,
a fishing reel would be an advantage. This last messenger is not
limited to the street car, but the form might be a locomotive and
train, an automobile or an air ship. The latter might have adjustable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
wings so as to be open to the breeze on the up trip and so be self
propelling as in the yacht, and by releasing that which holds the wings
open, they will close up, and the messenger would be ready for the
down trip. In the messenger races, it is necessary to measure the
string. At a tournament it is necessary to do this beforehand. It
is not necessary, but more interesting, to have all the contestants operating
at the same time. In case all cannot operate together, each
can be timed. Some very comical devices might be devised as messengers,
not so much for speed as for amusement. Certain motions might
be developed that would add much to the entertainment of all.</p>

<h3>MOVING DEVICES.</h3>


<p>Most of the moving devices on kites are operated best by means
of windmills. The windmill can be placed back of the kite out of
sight. Various movements can be devised such as opening and shutting
of eyes and mouth and moving of ears. Feet and hands can be made
to dangle without any device. The windmill can also be used for
decorative purposes.</p>

<p><b>Windmills.</b> There are two general kinds of windmills. Those
turning from left to right and vice versa, and those turning fore and
back. The last named type is used for eyes that turn. The eyes are
set in little rims of some stiff material, a thin piece of bamboo, shaving,
or stiff cardboard. Holes are cut in the covering of the kite and
these rims are pasted in so as to stand edgewise. These rims prevent
the interference of any obstruction to the revolving eyes. The eye
may be set in place by means of a wire running thru each side of the
rim and thru the eye. The eye has a smaller rim on which two half
circles of paper are pasted, see <a id="fig_148"></a><a href="#fig148">Fig. 148</a>. A little paper wound into
a little ball would be made by the Chinese boys, but a glass bead will
answer to keep the eye away from the rim of the opening. The two
semicircles of paper are on the two halves of the eye. In <a href="#fig148">Fig. 148</a>,
<i>a</i> is on the upper half of the front side while the other semicircle, <i>b</i>,
is on the lower half of the back. Sometimes little mirrors are pasted
to the eyes, as at <i>m</i>, to reflect the light as they spin around, which they
certainly do, if nicely set in their places. Some
use considerable black on one half and white
on the other, giving a blinking effect. This same
kind of revolving disk is sometimes used on
wires or cord to the outside of the kite, see Fig.
134.</p>

<p><b>The revolving device</b>, while not as familiar as our little windmills,
is more easily secured in position but it is not impossible and in fact
is not a very difficult task to fasten the windmills. The windmills
can be made of stiff paper, any stiff cover paper will do; they spin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
well and are very light. They are usually made of a square piece
of paper which is cut on the diagonal nearly to the center, <a id="fig_149"></a><a href="#fig149">Fig. 149</a>;
one of the points of each section is then brought a little past the center
and a pin pushed thru, <a id="fig_150"></a><a href="#fig150">Fig. 150</a>. These little whirligigs can be
attached with the pin to the framework of the kite at various places.
Larger mills can be made of stiffer paper, as bristol board, but the
larger sizes will need more anchorage. The wheel will need an axle
of wire and to secure it, a paper, perhaps several, will need to be
pasted to the wheel and on the wire to prevent its flopping over.
The wheels are made from a circular
piece and are slitted from the
circumference to near to the center
and the sections are curved by
drawing the paper over a pencil or
similar object until the right curvature
is obtained, <a id="fig_151"></a><a href="#fig151">Fig. 151</a>. All
the sections of a wheel are curved
the same way but where there are
more than one, part should turn
to the right and the others to the
left. The framework supporting
the axle should reach across the
opening and there should be a strip
on each side as shown in <a id="fig_152"></a><a href="#fig152">Fig. 152</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
If the fans will not remain curved, a wire can be run around the outer
edge, thus keeping the fans in place and at the proper angle. Other
windmills are made with wooden axles that have little diagonal cuts to
receive pieces of thin stiff cardboard as fans. These can usually be
purchased, but they can also be made; <a id="fig_153"></a><a href="#fig153">Fig. 153</a> has one fan removed.
Make a small block and with small saw, make little cuts on the diagonal
and set the fans in with glue. Some make little windmills of aluminum,
which are similar to the ones made of light cardboard. Windmills can
be applied in many ways; for example, they may represent wheels on an
automobile kite, <a id="fig_154"></a><a href="#fig154">Fig. 154</a>, in which the tires are large and the windmill
serves as the center of the wheel. When turning around it cannot
be seen that the tire is not turning. Another wheel is shown at a
in which small slanting fans are attached.</p>

<p>The most difficult part in making the auto kite
is to keep it light and in poise. It will readily be
seen that the automobile is a triangular box-kite.
The hood of the engine should be open at both ends,
with string across to represent screen. The hood
instead of being a dead weight will have considerable
lifting power, being part of a barrel kite. A framework is shown in <a id="fig_155"></a><a href="#fig155">Fig.
155</a>. The top of the auto might be black or tan, the body red, black,
grey, green or brown, the tires light tan, and the moving part of the
wheels light yellow.</p>

<p>The steamboat kite, Figs. <a id="fig_156"></a><a href="#fig156">156</a> and <a id="fig_157"></a><a href="#fig157">157</a>, is another application of
the moving wheel but this construction is simpler and the attachment
of wheel is better. In this model a part of the wheel is shielded from
the breeze, so the uneven pressure causes it to revolve. This is a
very feasible and interesting problem. <a id="fig_158"></a><a href="#fig158">Fig. 158</a> shows a kite with a
wagging head above it. When we understand this device, we should
be able to plan many others. The windmill is set in the open part of
the kite. Two cross-sticks are used so it is quite easy to attach a
vertical piece to the two for support of the aluminum wheel. A little
hub has a groove in it that a cord belt runs in, and from that to another
grooved wheel to the back of the kite, <a id="fig_159"></a><a href="#fig159">Fig. 159</a>. A lath nail cut off
for a small crank pin, <i>j</i>, is located near the outer edge of this grooved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
wheel. A vertical lever, <i>h</i>, with axis at <i>i</i>, has an elongated hole at
the lower end that works over the crank-pin and as <i>k</i> revolves, the
lever operates from side to side. The hole must be long enough for
the crank-pin to reach its highest and lowest point easily. The elongated
hole can be effected by extending a wire loop down from the
end of the vertical lever to work on the crank-pin. The wire should
be lashed with linen thread to the vertical lever and coated over with
glue. An object can be used on the upper end, such as a head, a flag,
etc. In the same manner, hands and feet may be extended and withdrawn,
a turtle might be made to draw in head and feet and many
other interesting operations, but in all of these the machinery must
work easily, must not lop over against anything else and above all
we must remember not to load down our kite with weight or overbalance
it with undue leverage at any part of the kite.</p>

<p>Another way of attaching to windmill is to make the wire axle
long enough to pass thru and at the back bend into a crank, <a id="fig_160"></a><a href="#fig160">Fig. 160</a>.
The lever <i>h</i> would work direct on this crank as it does on the crank-pin
in the device with the second grooved pulley, <i>k</i>, <a href="#fig159">Fig. 159</a>. To
make the head go up and down, use a round hole instead of the elongated
ones in the vertical shaft. A loop of wire, <a id="fig_161"></a><a href="#fig161">Fig. 161</a>, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
hold the upper part of the vertical lever in place, and in case of the
head bobbing up and down, the lever is not attached at <i>i</i>, <a href="#fig159">Fig. 159</a>,
but the loop, <a href="#fig161">Fig. 161</a>, must not be omitted.</p>

<p><b>Other Devices.</b> But windmills are not the only means of operating
moving parts of a kite. An extra line to the ground will give
opportunity to the kite flyer to open and shut eyes and mouth and
move ears at will. Ears could be made to grow a foot and then be
drawn back by light elastic bands. The mouth might open and a
red tongue run out, or a pocket in the mouth might be turned inside
out, thus releasing a shower of bits of paper, white, colored, gilt, and
silver. Let the imagination play for a time, then set the inventive
machinery of the brain to work and “watch us grow.”</p>

<h3>SUSPENDED FIGURES AND APPLIANCES.</h3>


<p>These devices are usually suspended from the kite line. It is necessary
to have enough suspension cords attached to prevent twisting up
with the main line. Most of the devices will float out and have some
lifting power of their own, but some will require a kite that can sustain
some weight, in some cases a pound or more.</p>

<p><b>Flags and Banners.</b> One of the prettiest attachments is the
American flag. This can be attached in two ways: first by means
of a vertical stick of some weight, <a id="fig_162-163"></a><a href="#fig162-163">Fig. 162</a>, and second by using the
horizontal stick, as in <a href="#fig162-163">Fig. 163</a>. A pleasing trick is to have the flag
folded (do not wind on the stick) and covered, tied loosely with bow-knots
that are easily untied, and when the flag is well up, the tripping
string is pulled and the flag released. The string of the bow-knot
passes down the kite line thru little loops of wire attached to the main
line to prevent the tripping string from getting twisted therein. If
two are operating, one can stand at a little distance so as not to get
the two strings twisted, and thus avoid the wire loops.</p>

Banners are used sometimes for schools, sometimes for advertising
and sometimes for just no particular purpose but the pleasure of doing
it. A few banners are shown: <a id="fig_164-167"></a><a href="#fig164-167">Fig. 164</a> represents the Grand Avenue

<p><b>Wireless Telegraphy.</b> The wireless has a great attraction for
most boys. Some attach antennae to the kite, others drop a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
of wires from the kite line, as in <a id="fig_169"></a><a href="#fig169">Fig. 169</a>. A stick is suspended similar
to a banner, except that it requires only two suspension cords;
another stick hangs by the wires about ten feet below, and below this
the wires come together and a wire follows the kite line to the receiver
and to the ground. Caution is here given against the use of a wire
kite line. One boy tried this and when the kite lowered in a lull of
the breeze the wire crossed the trolley line and in the mix-up the boy
became entangled in the line by attempting
to get his kite up again,
and received quite a shock; but
there was no serious results. His
instrument and attachments were
working splendidly. The winding
of the coil is a very good problem
for any boy.</p>

<p><b>Photography.</b> Some boys are
interested in photography, and the
kite gives opportunity for taking
bird’s-eye views. The kodak must
rest on a framework and the tripping
line be so attached as not to
cause the instrument to swing when
the shutter is snapped. The tripping
can be accommodated by
means of the rear suspension cord,
<a id="fig_170"></a><a href="#fig170">Fig. 170</a>. The shutter should trip
very easily so as to cause as little
swinging as possible. An extension
of the lever might be an advantage. The two sticks of the framework
should be halved together so as to bring the upper surfaces level. A
screw-eye placed in the cross-stick directly below the tripping lever holds
the tripping string so that it draws on the camera in line with its own
seating on the framework, and causes the minimum amount of swaying.

<p><b>Signaling.</b> Signaling can be done by means of a red and white
flag, and the code used by the wig wag system, or one similar can be used.
<a id="fig_175"></a><a href="#fig175">Fig. 175</a> shows the rod on which the two signals are used. Screw-eyes
would be better than pulley wheels as there would be no slipping out
of the grooves, and there would not be enough friction to be objectionable.
The cord operating the two signals should be continuous,
passing from the ground to one signal, thru the screw-eye above, then
thru the other screw-eye to the second signal and from that back to
the ground. The distance from the signal to the screw-eye should be
convenient for manipulation by the operator, for while one flag is up
the other is down, and this distance corresponds to the pull and relaxation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of the hands of the operator. The signals can be red and
white flags, or a device like <a id="fig_176"></a><a href="#fig176">Fig. 176</a>, in which a full surface of color
would always be in view. Sometimes a flag flying directly toward
or away from you is not a very large object to see. This last device
is made of two good sized cardboard disks, each cut half way thru,
<a id="fig_177"></a><a href="#fig177">Fig. 177</a>, and set at right angles to each other. The red and white
is placed there to help in location of the other signals, as to up and
would read, red and light, that is <i>r</i> is red or right, while <i>l</i> is left or
light. So the same code operates for both. The center black square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
down and right and left. The code given is one that we have used
somewhat, but not many have mastered it as yet. It can be used for
night signalling, as red and white or light, would read <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> too.</p>

<p>We will illustrate with the letter <i>b</i> The code reads L R R L.
At night this would be flashed: light, then red, red again, then light.
On the kite signal we would run up the light signal, then the red,
red again, and then the light. Just so with the wig wag. The wig
wag flag would be waved to left then two to the right then one to
the left and back again to center. If we were spelling out <i>B O Y</i>,
a little pause would be made after <i>B</i> had been signalled, then left,
right, or light, red would be signalled, and after a slight pause again,
the three reds or three waves of the wig wag flag to the right. A
little longer pause between words and then the next word would follow.</p>

<p>The trapeze performer, <a href="#fig180-181">Fig. 181</a>, must be placed edgewise in the
swing, and the lower stick must be made so it will revolve. The
grooved pulley is stationary on the lower rod and should have a good
sized grove so as to accommodate two or three turns of the operating
line, which should run double to the ground. It is well to have such
lines fastened to a stick so that the hand may hold in the center between
the two, see <a id="fig_182-183"></a><a href="#fig182-183">Fig. 182</a>. By a twist of the wrist the ends of the stick
can be forced to and fro which turns the rod that the performer is
on, forward or back. This will suggest other forms of trapeze performers.</p>

<p>Color devices and optical illusions could also be arranged. A color
device like <a href="#fig182-183">Fig. 183</a> would be an interesting study on the ground,
and would be very interesting up a little way on the kite line. Each
section, as <i>a</i>, is independent of the others, and the sections should
alternate as to directions, the first going to the right, the next to
the left and so on. It is as easy to make them go in one direction
as the other. A vertical wire reaches from top to bottom of the framework<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and beads should be placed between sections, and to the outside
at the top and bottom. The colors of <i>a</i> are red, yellow, and blue,
but white could take the place of some color, and black of another
section. As the sections are not likely to turn with the same rapidity,
there should be a constant change of combination of colors.</p>

<p>Light forms that fill out with the breeze can be made of tissue
paper and attached to the kite line. Ugly monsters with large mouths
and highly colored bodies with heavy lines on them to outline scales
are very striking. It is necessary to have these open at both ends or
they will be torn open, also it is best to have a light framework about
the head to keep that in shape; the rest of the body will usually be
taken care of. Long serpents and fish are good for the purpose. If
the grotesque does not appeal to one, long and short streamers can
be used in abundance. A kite line decorated with pointed streamers
of various colors would be very beautiful. Japanese lanterns might
be festooned along the line, and to reduce the weight, the bottom could
be removed. If kite flying is indulged in at night, fewer lanterns can
be used, and these lighted.</p>

<h3>BALLOONS AND PARACHUTES.</h3>


<p><b>Balloons</b> that really go up are always attractive but by thoughtful
planning they can be made much more beautiful. A nice white balloon
against a blue sky is very pleasing, but most boys like more color. The
hot air balloons are made of tissue paper, and consist of an inverted
bag with a light piece of reed at the bottom to keep the mouth open.
The most successful shape is shown by <a id="fig_184-192"></a><a href="#fig184-192">Fig. 184</a>. This need not be
perfectly round on top, but may be pointed, as in <a href="#fig184-192">Fig. 185</a>. If the
balloon is too nearly round like a ball, it is liable to turn over and
allow the hot air to escape. If the balloon is too long and slender
vertically, it would probably flounder around in the breeze too much.
There is not the variety possible in balloons that there is in kites,
as no ballast can be attached that is of much service. In some shapes
only a very little is necessary to keep them in an upright position, in
this case a little ballast will suffice, and a number of shapes can be
made with this addition. The ballast should be suspended by strings
from the reed at the bottom, see <a href="#fig184-192">Fig. 186</a>. The ballast may only be
a piece of cardboard, but in some cases that little is very necessary.</p>

<p>Some of the boys try models of the dirigible, but usually they get
something too large for hot air manipulation. The dirigible is more
of a cigar-shaped balloon. Strings run down to a framework that
carries the propeller, which is a paper windmill in this case, but it is
very difficult to keep these representative parts light enough to be
carried by the hot air medium.</p>

<p>In making a balloon like <a href="#fig184-192">Fig. 184</a> the covering is made in tapering
sections. The pattern given is for a five-foot balloon. The width at
the lower end of the section is five inches, three feet farther up fifteen
inches, and it comes to a point at the top. The edges of these sections
form a long curve, <a href="#fig184-192">Fig. 187</a>. Five feet would require just a little
over two lengths of tissue paper. There are seven sections in the
balloon.</p>

 <a href="#fig_184-192"><span class="goback">↑</span></a></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><b>Inflation.</b> Two methods are used to fill the balloons. A wire is
stretched across the frame of the mouth of the balloon and another at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
right angles to it. A ball of excelsior having been soaked in paraffin
is attached at the crossing of the two. The ball should be flattened
into a disc about two inches in diameter and one inch in thickness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Holding the balloon up by the top the paraffin disc is lighted with
a parlor match. It burns and creates heat that collects in the upper
part of the balloon. When it is filled so that it lifts a little and wants
to get away it is released carrying up the heat generator with it. The
paraffin ball continues to furnish hot air until it burns out. A balloon
so equipped will travel several blocks, high up in the air. The
paraffin ball is also wound about with a very fine wire which is also
used to attach the ball to the wires across the opening of the balloon.
It will be seen at once that a good sized opening is necessary and in
this design, the reed band is ten inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The other method of filling is by means of a stove pipe furnace
or some similar device, but in this case all the heating is done on the
ground. A hole is dug in the ground and the stovepipe is banked in
as a chimney. A fire is built in the hole and the hot air goes up thru
the pipe to the balloon that is suspended over it. If it was not for
the stove pipe the blaze would ignite the walls of the balloon. Some
quite large balloons have been sent up in this way. A piece of tin or
sheet iron is good to make a cover for the hole in the ground so as
to prevent the dirt from falling in on the fire. Some use a little oil
on the fire, but there should not be too much else the blaze will reach
up thru the pipe so far as to burn up the balloon. It is well to have
a cord above so as to hold the balloon up and if it is too high to hold with
the hand, a pole with a wire on the end of it that could be readily
released might be used. As the bag gets inflated it is best to remove
the pole and hold to the bottom by the hands.</p>

<p>In pasting the pieces of paper together, there should be about ¼”
laps. Care must be observed in the pasting that there are no detached
places, places where the paste does not stick well, as the hot air will
escape. In the model given, one section was blue, two white, one
red, and three white, making seven in all. Sometimes the colors are
worked in differently. Half of a section will be one color, and the
other half another, and next to each will be placed some contrasting
color. Still further breaking up can be done until quite a design is
worked out.</p>

<p>It is possible to decorate a plain balloon with surface design, but
it must be bold and not over done. An example or two may be helpful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
<a href="#fig184-192">Figs. 188, 189, 190</a>. Yellow and black, black and red, purple
and white, green and white, and many other good combinations can
be selected, but two or three colors are better than many. The best
grade of tissue paper is very much superior to the cheap, as the tendency
of the cheap to split out is very unsatisfactory and there are thin porous
spots. The French tissues, so called, are the best, and they come
in many shades of good colors.</p>

<p><b>Parachutes</b> are other forms of balloon. They do not ascend from
the ground, but are released up in the air and float downward. Sometimes
a current of air will catch one and carry it far up and away.
They are made like an umbrella covering, sometimes in sections and
again in one piece, <a href="#fig184-192">Figs. 191 and 192</a>. When made in sections, they
are very much like the upper one-third of a balloon. They are made
from the size of your hand to beauties that are eight feet across;
when made of brilliantly colored paper, they are very interesting. They
have a weight suspended underneath to keep them upright in the descent.
Parachutes are usually taken up on a kite line and are released
well up in the air. The usual method of shaking them off the line
is not as good as a definite release by a tripping string from the ground.
If large ones are used, one at a time is sufficient and is simple to release.
The parachute is tied with a bow-knot to the kite line with
the extra string and as this string is pulled the knot comes untied and
the parachute is released. When smaller ones are used they can be
tied in a series and the lowest down on the string or the highest can
be released, then the next, and so on. The same string can be used
to tie on a long series.</p>

<p>No matter how small the parachute, it must have its suspension
strings and weight. We have tried parachute showers that have only
been a partial success, thus far. A bunch of these little parachutes
each with its own string tied to the kite line, have been released, but
in pulling them up they are so liable to get twisted up, that when
released they cling together. If they could be carefully laid in some
kind of an apron that would protect them from the breeze, I am sure
they might be tumbled out so as to separate without entanglement.
It is a very pretty sight to see a large bunch turned loose, each spreading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
its tiny night cap to the air as it starts downward. They should
be of all colors, and for this purpose the one piece models and one
foot in diameter are best. There is always a scramble for the souvenir
parachutes when they are released. If one had a rubber stamp outfit,
it would be interesting to print something on their cover. Thread
would be used for the suspension cords and perhaps a shingle nail for
the weight.</p>

<p>Another method of release given elsewhere is sometimes used by
the Chinese and Japanese, is effected by using a lighted punk such as
used to set off firecrackers; when the punk burns down far enough, it
burns off a supporting thread, thus releasing the object held.</p>

<h3>REELS.</h3>

<p><b>Reels</b> are very convenient for most kite flying and quite necessary
for high flying where so much string must be let out and wound in
again, but an absolute necessity for events where racing is an important
feature. Many devices have been used at our tournaments and some
have been very clever. A simple and effective reel can be rigged up in
a kerosene box. The box is long enough to allow a seat for the kite
flyer, a foot brake can be arranged, and an all around satisfactory reel
can be made at light expense. <a id="fig_193"></a><a href="#fig193">Fig. 193</a> shows such a reel fully equipped.
A portion of the top is cut away so as to expose the spool of the reel,
it being necessary to see if the line is winding properly, to see if it is
nearly off, and to watch for knots or entanglements. A measuring
device might also be attached, similar to cyclometers used on bicycles.
The end of the box is partially cut away but not the full width of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
box, the portions remaining at the sides preventing the kite line from
getting off the ends of the spools. The portion remaining should be
a little wider than the thickness of the flanges of the spool. The
axle will usually be a broomstick owing to the ease with which it may
be obtained and being hardwood, is very satisfactory. A piece of pipe
can be used but is hard to drill thru for the pins that hold spool and
crank to axle, also the holes that take pins on each side of box to prevent
slipping endwise. Iron washers are used on the outside of box and
between spool ends and inside of box.</p>

<p><b>The crank</b> is shown in the drawing and needs no special directions.
<b>The pin holding the crank to the</b> axle might be a small bolt with a
nut, which adds strength in the prevention of splitting of the end
of the wood. A good spool for the reel might be found at a hardware
store. Chains come on well made spools that are excellent for
reels. These can be fastened to axle by slanting pins; nails will answer
if they are not left out too far thru the outside of the flanges
of the spool; also pins may be put down thru the drum part of the
spool thru the axle. In this case small holes would have to be drilled
from opposite sides of the drum.</p>

<p>Other drums can be made similar to <a id="fig_194-196"></a><a href="#fig194-196">Fig. 194</a>. The axle is secured
to two wooden disks and the center is built up of other pieces
as in <a href="#fig194-196">Fig. 195</a>, or by wooden rods as in <a href="#fig194-196">Fig. 196</a>.</p>

<p><b>A brake</b> is a great convenience
when letting out string, as the reel
sometimes runs ahead of the kite
and so entangles the string; by a
little pressure of the foot on the
brake, the unwinding ceases. The
brake should act directly on the
edge of the flange of the spool. The
lever of the brake would pass thru
the left side of the box, not more
than two inches up from the bottom,
<a id="fig_197"></a><a href="#fig197">Fig. 197</a>. In case the spool is
too short for the width of the box, wooden blocks can be used to fill
in the space, but the opening in the end of the box that the kite line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
passes thru must be no wider than the distance between the flanges.</p>

 <a href="#fig_198-199"><span class="goback">↑</span></a></p>
</div><!--end figleft-->

<p>Another axle that has been mentioned is made of pipe. The
pipe can be one inch in diameter, and must be drilled for the pins
that fasten the spool to it. A three-eighths or five-sixteenths hole can
be drilled near the end of the pipe outside the box, in which an iron rod
is riveted with its outer end bent at a right angle. The rod forms
the crank of the reel. If one has access to a heavy metal vise, the
axle and crank can be made of one piece, <a id="fig_198-199"></a><a href="#fig198-199">Fig. 198</a>. If one wishes
the reel to run very easily, a washer that fits the axle nicely can be
fastened to the side of the box with two screws, <a href="#fig198-199">Fig. 199</a>. The hole
in the wood should be a little
larger than the hole in the washer,
thus making the washer a
bearing for the axle. I have one
that turns very freely this way. The wires running down to pegs in the
ground, shown in <a href="#fig193">Fig. 193</a>, are for the purpose of anchoring the reel
when the pull of the kite is on.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Thus far the box has been the real support, but other frames can
be made as well, <a id="fig_200-202"></a><a href="#fig200-202">Fig. 200</a>. The brake is applied at the rear on this reel,
and is operated either by hand or foot. The heavy wires are for
anchoring purposes, otherwise the construction may be the same as in
<a href="#fig193">Fig. 193</a>.</p>

<p>Another way of securing the metal axle to the wooden spool is
as follows: Drill two holes thru the pipe just far enough apart to
allow spool to fit between. The holes should be just large enough to
allow a 16d or 20d nail to go thru. Cut off the heads of the nails,
fit in holes with spool on axle, and with good sized staples fasten
pins (nails) to sides of spools, see <a href="#fig200-202">Fig. 201</a>. For the crank, a ⅜”
hole can be drilled at the outer end of axle to receive a ⅜” rod bent
at one end to form the handle. The end of the crank that passes thru
the axle might be threaded about 1¼” so as to put a nut on each side,
see <a href="#fig200-202">Fig. 202</a>.</p>

<p><b>A Large Reel.</b> The two general plans given above are for comparatively
small reels. <a id="fig_203"></a><a href="#fig203">Fig. 203</a> shows a reel that winds in over four
feet at a turn. It has but one bearing, being
attached to the standard by a large bolt
for an axle. It would be well to have a
piece of pipe just large enough to allow the
bolt to turn freely and just long enough to
reach thru the wheel as a bushing, for this
is much more like a wheel. The sides or
flanges are made of two ply wood, in one-half
of the thickness the grain runs one way
and the other half at right angles to it, so
that it prevents warping and is not liable to
spit. There is no real drum, but small
wooden rods, or slim bolts, hold the sides together, also apart, and are set
about two inches in from the outside circumference. In the drawing, the
wheel being 18” in diameter, the bolts or rods are in a circle 14” in diameter.
The bolts or rods should be about eight in number. If wood rods,
doweling, are used, they would be glued at both ends and no other posts
would be necessary, but with the bolts, posts will be needed to prevent the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
sides from coming together. Four posts will be sufficient. No crank
is necessary on this reel as a handle can be fastened to the side of one
of the large discs. A brake can be attached underneath as in the
last reel. The axle must be made very rigid in the standard as it
has to support all the pull of the reel. This is a first class reel for
fast work.</p>

<p>Discs can be obtained at some box factories for seven and ten cents
apiece for sizes 15½” and 19½” in diameter, respectively. They are
made of two ply wood and make good reels. A good way to get the
holes opposite is to clamp the two discs together and bore all the holes
thru both at the same time. Others make reels very much like our
grandmothers’ yarn reels. Two arms are halved together and short
cross-pieces are attached to the ends, <a id="fig_204"></a><a href="#fig204">Fig. 204</a>. For speed they are made
with long arms and take up a good length of string at a single turn.</p>

<p>Another way of building up a reel is shown in <a id="fig_205"></a><a href="#fig205">Fig. 205</a>. A square
block has fans nailed or screwed to each side. The ends of the fans
are shaped out to receive the kite line. The end of the square center
piece can be rounded so as to pass thru a round hole of the framework,
or a hole can be bored thru the square piece and a pipe or rod inserted
as with the others. For heavy work where large string pulling kites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
are used, geared reels are practical. <a id="fig_206"></a><a href="#fig206">Fig. 206</a> shows a picture of a boy
and his reel rigged up with a chain drive, utilizing parts of a bicycle.
This was devised for speed, but it needs flanges at the ends of the
drum. If one wished to put time enough on a reel, he could rig one
up out of parts of a bicycle that could be manipulated by the feet. A
coaster brake would let out the string and the winding in could be
made as swift as any kite would stand. The wheel used for the drum
portion would need quite a little modification to prevent the string
from jumping off. As the usual frame would not admit of any widening,
some additional framework would also be necessary to make it
stable enough. If one is going to do much kite flying, it pays to take
time to make a good reel, not the last one described necessarily, as that is
more for speed, and is not as convenient as a number of others, but a
good simple reel is a great satisfaction.</p>

<h3>AEROPLANE MODELS.</h3>


<p><b>Aeroplane Models</b> are small sized aeroplanes. They may be
divided into four classes:</p>

<p>A. Small models of large machines, made for the purposes of
construction.</p>

<p>B. Small models of large machines made for the purpose of flying
as kites.</p>

<p>C. Gliders.</p>

<p>D. Self-propelling models.</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that this chapter should be expanded
into a book by itself. Mr. Collins has written an excellent book, “The
Second Book of Model Aeroplanes”, on the subject, and I hope the
readers of this book will look it up, as it will be worth while. In
dealing with the subject in this chapter we can not go into it very
deeply and not many plans can be given, but we will try to touch here
and there some of the important features of construction.</p>

<p>I have grouped the model aeroplanes into four divisions, but before
we proceed it will be well to notice the various classes of large machines.
There is the monoplane or one plane type; the biplane or two planes,
one above the other; and the multiplanes in which several planes are
used. The first two have survived, and form the very large percentage
of all that are attempted these days. I should like to make clear that
I do not recommend, even discourage, any attempt at gliders large
enough to carry the maker, and the aeroplane in which a motor engine
is to be placed. There is too much danger connected with them, and our
lives and limbs are too precious a gift to be trifled with in such unnecessary
ventures. The little models, however, are harmless and yet
are very fascinating, even when there is no thought of their embodiment
in a large machine.</p>

<p><b>In group A</b>, where the worker seeks to imitate a large machine in
miniature, the joy of the undertaking lies in the processes involving
very accurate work and nicety of finish. There is a fascination for
young people in the making of things in miniature. The models made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
in group A are usually larger than in group D, as the pieces of the
framework need a little more material to work to advantage, while in
D, the parts must be kept light. Weight is not so much of an item in
group A.</p>

<p>The photograph of the Curtis model, <a id="fig_207"></a><a href="#fig207">Fig. 207</a>, has a clock spring
works in it, but it is of no service. This is a very fine piece of work
and has been admired by many. Outside of the clock works the model<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
is all handmade. Little turn buckles for tightening the guy wires were
made, as well as the little metal attachments to which the ends of the
guy wires are attached. The silk covering was stretched and oiled on
the frame.</p>

<p>An equally well made model is shown in <a id="fig_208"></a><a href="#fig208">Fig. 208</a>. In this monoplane
all the curving of ribs and trussing of frame were very accurately
done. It will be recognized that this is a very excellent piece of work
and the outlines of the planes are very beautiful and well proportioned.
The planes are supported at the outer ends by careful adjustment of
wires above and below the wings. Notice the two little braces above
the center of the framework to which the guy wires are attached.
Turn-buckles are used on this model also. The horizontal and vertical
planes to the rear of the model, but to the front in the picture, were
ideas original with the maker, altho I have seen pictures similar to this
since.</p>

<p>Some make up these models in good shape for the purpose of using
them as attractions in show windows. Merchants will sometimes give
a rental for a good model. Very often when used as a display, an
electric motor is installed in them so as to run the propellers.</p>

<p><b>In group B</b>, the models are made to fly as kites. It is possible to
gain much knowledge about the motor driven models by patient study
on the aeroplane kite. The kite flying side will not help so much as
the gliding. When the aeroplane kite is well up, if the string is allowed
considerable slack, the model will glide if well balanced and if the
planes are tilted properly. Balance will be necessary both to right and
left and fore and aft. It is very interesting to get such a model pulled
well up in the air and have a release that will cut the kite line. The
punk method is good, only that we would like to have better control
of just the time for cutting loose. The punk has this advantage however
that not knowing just when it will cut loose you are held in happy
suspense, just as you wait for a bite on your fish line.</p>

<p>Another simple releasing device can be used: hooks are placed on
the kite at each point of attachment of the bridle, and on the end of
each string of the bridle is tied a small ring, which is to be hooked on
the hook of the kite. The hooks must bend back and downward and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
must be stiff enough not to bend. Of course the kite line will have to
be kept quite taut until time for release, when, if the line is slackened
suddenly, the rings drop off, thus releasing the kite line. If it glides
well some interesting things will develop. There will be swoops and
glides, and loop the loops and all sorts of gyrations before it reaches
the ground. If one is going to make a model just to fly in the air
without the maneuvering, but to look like an aeroplane in the air, it
should have the bridle placed so as to cause the kite to stay as near the
horizontal as possible. In order to do this, the upper loop of the bridle
should be shortened or the lower one lengthened as on a tailless or
any other kite. On the tailless kite one can shift the bridle so as to
make the kite stay nearly over head, in fact I have had them pass the
zenith and dive over to the other side, and that well up in the air. A
propeller that is turned by the breeze will help considerably in giving it
a realistic touch. <a href="#fig099">Fig. 99</a> is very good for aeroplane kites. The side
wings can be extended and modified, as in <a id="fig_209-215"></a><a href="#fig209-215">Fig. 209</a>, or the cross-pieces
can be bowed up, as in <a href="#fig209-215">Fig. 210</a>. The bridle should be attached only
in two places.</p>

folded paper glider made by the children soars excellently; try an
aeroplane kite on that plan, <a href="#fig209-215">Fig. 214</a>. Another modification of <a href="#fig209-215">Fig.
214</a> is the bird aeroplane kite, <a href="#fig209-215">Fig. 215</a>. In this a plane is placed about
half way from front to back. The ends of the wings get their curve
from the back stick, a piece of heavy reed, and the outline of the bird
is also of reed. By drawing the shape on a board the reed can be bent
to the shape. The reed should be wet and tacks should be driven at
each side to keep the shape until dry. This kite, if well made, should
glide for a very long distance.</p>

<p>It would take too much space to go into details with each design,
but the drawings I think will be sufficient for most readers who may be
planning these models, especially where framework and finished kite
are both given.</p>

<h3>GLIDERS.</h3>


<p><b>In group C</b> is to be found the most profitable source of study for
the self-propelling model aeroplane. The glider has no motor and no
propeller, but is made on the plan of the motored model in the construction
and adjustments. The glider is usually made smaller at first,
increasing the size to the actual model later. The glider is more useful
for study, if it is made heavier in comparison with the motored model.
The glider can be thrown by the hand as if it were a spear, <a id="fig_216"></a><a href="#fig216">Fig. 216</a>,
or it can be thrown by a rubber cord, <a id="fig_217"></a><a href="#fig217">Fig. 217</a>, or by a springy stick,
<a id="fig_218"></a><a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>.</p>

</div><!--end figleft-->

<p>All experiments except those intended for adverse conditions, should
be made either indoors where there is no wind, or away from buildings
far enough to be out of reach of the whirls that are always present near
buildings. Heavy paper can be used for planes in some of the experimenting,
and even much may be learned by the use of paper models
thruout the whole construction, but a little stiffening with small thin
strips as reinforcement is better in most cases.</p>

<p>For the model that is thrown like a spear from the hand, wood is
used for all parts. The spine can be ¾” × ¾” × 30”, the fore plane ¼” × 2½”
in widest part × 8”, and the rear plane ¼” × 4½” in widest part × 20”.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Bevel off the under side of the front edge of both planes. Fasten the
planes to the spine with rubber string, rubber bands will do, this will
allow easy adjustment back and forth on the spine. There are many
experiments that can be tried with this model. Move the foreplane
back, try; move back plane foreward, try; move foreplane foreward,
try, and so on. This model and all other models are just the opposite
of teeter boards. If too much pressure comes at one end, up it goes, if
too much at the other, up that end goes, while the same thing applied
to the teeter, that end goes down. It then seems clear at the start that
we must have balance fore and aft, as well as right and left, with the
kite we must balance right and left, but if the up and down does not
quite tally we can counteract by adjustment of the bridle, but on gliders
and model aeroplanes, there are no bridles. The little ship must go
“all by its lonely”.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>Another adjustment is possible, and probably will be necessary, and
that is tipping of the planes. By the use of little wedges, the front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
edges of the planes may be tilted up, and by trial we can decide what
we think the best angle, which should not be great. Possibly ¼” might
be used under the front edge. It will pay to spend much time in experimentation
on these gliders, and it should be carried on until long
graceful glides are accomplished.</p>

<p>It will be discovered long before this, that in a very large percentage
of cases the arrangement of planes is reversed in model aeroplanes and
the large machines. The small planes are placed forward and are used
largely as elevating surfaces. A few models have the large plane forward.
It will also be noticed in looking over plans of model aeroplanes
that a large majority are monoplanes, while in the large machines there
are more biplanes.</p>

<p><b>Warping.</b> No warping of the planes is necessary in the glider that
has been discussed, but it is well in the lighter models to have some
warping called camber, in the larger planes especially. Another warping
is from end to end of the plane, that is, the ends tip upward, never
downward. Sometimes models are made with the large plane warped
from front to back, and with the small plane bent upward on each
side, and again the large plane is sometimes bent in both directions as
it is made. The last is more easily done when wire frameworks are
used in the self-propelling models. In <a href="#fig217">Fig. 217</a> the model is made
lighter, the spine being a heavy piece of reed with a hook bent on the
end and the planes ⅛” or 1/16” veneer wood.</p>

<p>The sling shot device for throwing the glider is made of heavy
spring wire, and will require a strong metal vice to bend it in. A
forked stick can be used, or one can be cut out with a turning saw.
<a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a> is quite similar to <a href="#fig217">Fig. 217</a> in weight, but a square spine
¼” × ⅜” × 18” with planes ⅛” or 1/16” × 2” × 6”. 2” in widest part and the
other ⅛” or 1/16” × 4” × 12”. 4” in widest part. The force used to drive
this glider is given thru a springy stick of some tough wood, as oak or
hickory. The stick should be quite stiff so as to resist more pressure
before its release. A little block on the under side of the spine might
have a little hole in the back to receive a small nail in the end of the
bow stick used to throw the glider, this will prevent the bow stick from
slipping off in the throwing process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
One other glider should be mentioned, and that is one with sheet
metal planes, <a id="fig_219"></a><a href="#fig219">Fig. 219</a>. This has advantages and disadvantages. When
it strikes hard against some object, the metal is liable to bend, also if
it is thrown violently, and should strike someone on the face or hands
it might cut. The metal surfaces can be bent into any shape. All
corners should be rounded. Some of these gliders can be thrown long
distances if properly adjusted.</p>

<p>After working awhile with gliders, we can try model aeroplanes
that are suited for the instalment of motors later. Everything must be
made as light and strong as possible. All kinds of ribbed surfaces, keels,
and light wire braced frameworks, are utilized. Everything that would
be used in a self-propelling model, except the propeller and motor.</p>

<p>Make the planes movable so they may be balanced as to pressure, by
moving them back and forth, flex more, flex less, tilt more, tilt less,
until you get a good glider out of it, then attach your motor and propeller.
Some may think best to put motor and propeller on, and do all
the experimenting, but it takes time to make a good propeller, and the
fewer jams it has the better, so it is better to do some experimenting
with the model before the propeller is added. The motor will make
practically no difference in the balance, so there would be no advantage
of putting it on for experiments in gliding.</p>

<p>We are now ready for some attempts on the self-propelling models.</p>

<h3>MODEL AEROPLANES.</h3>


<p><b>Self-propelling air devices</b> must be of the lightest possible weight
and yet they must have strength. There will be no attempt to give a
great variety of model aeroplanes; but a few can be discussed, perhaps
three or four. The first is a little practice model that has been of great
service to me, both for study and for instruction to others. It is small
and will not fly far. I can wind it up and turn it loose in a schoolroom.
It hits rather hard sometimes but nothing has happened to it beyond a
broken propeller, and the rubber bands that are used to tie the planes
to the spine have been broken.</p>

<p>In <a id="fig_220"></a><a href="#fig220">Fig. 220</a> the model is shown in two views, the plan and side
elevation. The planes are made of 1/16” birch veneer, but other woods
will do. The small fore plane is bent at quite a sharp angle and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
shaped as shown in <a id="fig_221-222"></a><a href="#fig221-222">Fig. 221</a>. Steam the plane thoroly over the teakettle
and place it under pressure until dry and it will remain so bent.
The plane is also tilted up a little by means of a small wedge.</p>

<p>The spine is made of spruce and is
¼” × ¼” × 12”. The large plane has about ⅛”
camber and is bent as shown in <a href="#fig221-222">Fig. 222</a>.
Lay a strip as thick as the desired camber
on a board that you can nail brads into.
Steam the veneer for the plane and lay in
the ⅛” strip in this case about one-third the
distance back from the front edge, bend
down until the edge touches the board underneath the strip and drive
brads in slanting so as to hold it down. The brads can be bent down a
little after they are driven in. By using brads on both sides the veneer can
be held down until dry. The outline can be cut away before or after the
bending. The decoration of course is not essential, but it is interesting to
beautify it a little. The anchor block for the propeller shaft is of wood
¼” × 1” × 1” and is glued and nailed with brads to the rear end of the
spine. A piece of tin ⅜” wide is bent about the top of the anchor block, <i>f</i>,
<a id="fig_223"></a><a href="#fig223">Fig. 223</a>. The hole in the wood should be larger than the propeller
shaft while the hole in the tin should make a good
fit. In this way the bearing is on the tin instead
of the wood, and reduces the friction to a minimum.
After the tin is on, the block should be
wound with linen thread and coated with glue
or shellac.</p>

<p>The propeller shaft is made from a bicycle
spoke, <a href="#fig223">Fig. 223</a>; two of these can be purchased for a nickel. The long nut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
shown at <i>b</i>, is cut with a metal saw in two places, giving small nuts <i>c</i> and
<i>d</i>; <i>c</i> is used on the inside and <i>d</i> on the outside of the propeller. The spoke
is then cut off long enough to pass thru the propeller, a glass bead as a
washer, and the anchor block, with room for a good hook on the end for
the attachment of the rubber motor. The propeller will be discussed further
in the next chapter; the only thing to be mentioned here is the size of
the blank from which it is made, which is ½” × 1” × 4”. Another piece
of the spoke is bent as in <a id="fig_224-225"></a><a href="#fig224-225">Fig. 224</a>, and is inserted in the fore end of the
spine and bent still further into shape like <a href="#fig224-225">Fig. 225</a>. This gives the
other anchor hook for the rubber motor. One other piece is the small
keel shown in the side view. A groove is made in the under side of
the spine and the keel set in with glue.</p>

<p>I am using four rounds of 1/16”
rubber string for the motor. That
makes eight strands. Six do very
well. This is a very useful little
model but it will not fly over fifty
feet, or mine has not, but the fact
that it does not fly far, gives you
opportunity to study its start, its
landing, and its flight. The long
distance models are out of observation
range so soon that we miss
the chance to diagnose their crazy
symptoms, if they have any, and
most of them have some.</p>

<p>At the beginning of model
aeroplane making, everyone seemed to try to see how much surface could
be exposed in the planes, now the best models are those with as narrow
planes as it is possible to use and still support the air craft. The reason is
obvious—there is so much skin friction on broad surfaces. At the beginning,
many were inclined to scoff at the rubber band motor, but since
flights have been made considerably over a half mile, with this same
power, it seems good enough for anybody. Most of the long distance flyers
have long framework so as to accommodate long strands of rubber,
which allow much increase in the winding up of the motor.</p>

<p><b>A Good Model.</b> A simple and effective model is shown in <a id="fig_226"></a><a href="#fig226">Fig.
226</a>. Lay out a light framework, as shown in <a id="fig_227-228"></a><a href="#fig227-228">Fig. 227</a>. It is the
combination of a tailless kite and a triangular box-kite. Three long
sticks, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, are used for the triangular portion and three cross-sticks,
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, are for the wing supports. A vertical post, <i>g</i>, about ¼” × ⅜” × 8”
is used in the center of the rear (the wide part), to stiffen the frame and
give an anchorage for the propeller shaft. Four light braces, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, and
<i>k</i>, make it possible to use lighter material than one would suspect for
the entire framework. In a model 3’ long, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, need not be
larger than 3/16” square, but there must be no split or uneven places in
a stick so small. The braces ⅛” × 3/16” would be plenty large. The two
upper pieces, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, should be flattened on the inside of the front end
so as to make them join together, terminating in a point. The lower
spine, <i>a</i>, should be flattened on the upper side for the same reason. All
three should be glued and lashed together with linen thread. A triangular
block, <i>l</i>, should be placed about 4” back from the front end
with a strong cup-hook screwed in the side toward the rear, on which
the ring of the rubber motor is attached. The block, <i>l</i>, must be well
secured to the triangular framework with glue and thread. The cross-piece,
<i>d</i>, is 30” long and is bowed upward as is shown by <a href="#fig227-228">Fig. 228</a>.
Piece <i>e</i> is 24” long, 5” in front of <i>d</i>, and both are 3/16” × ¼”. ⅛” × 3/16”
will be heavy enough for <i>f</i>, and this should be bowed much more than
<i>d</i>, and <i>e</i>. It will be necessary to steam this piece a little. Chinese rice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
tissue will be good for covering. Cover the underside of the two planes,
and the underside of the triangular framework which is similar to the
hull of a boat, and acts as a keel. Test out well as a glider. Put more
and less curve to bows, and experiment for poise of model. A small
piece of tin on each side of the support will give a good bearing for the
propeller shaft. The hole in the wood should be a trifle larger than
the shaft. String is run from both
ends of <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> to the front end of
the framework but is not attached
to <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>When long models are made

A little 1/16” oak veneer cut in
strips 3/16” wide would be very
serviceable for the purpose of support
in trussing the long spine. It

The propeller shaft bearing is of metal and is lashed to the cross-piece,

<a href="#fig230-232">Fig. 232</a>, and lashed to the under side of the base. The planes are
similar to those in the next model. 1” × 1½” × 7½” propeller blanks are
used. Try about fourteen strands of 1/16” string rubber for each motor,
seven rounds.</p>

<p><b>My favorite model aeroplane</b>
is shown in <a id="fig_233"></a><a href="#fig233">Fig. 233</a>. It
had made some very pretty flights
when it took a notion to glide into
a young man’s bicycle as he was
riding by. Well, there was no improvement
on the aeroplane when
the chain and spokes of the bicycle
were thru with it.</p>

<p>The framework is light and is
spread well at the rear. The two
spines are 3/16” × ¼” × 33” and they
come together at the forward end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
the vertical section being ¼”. Nine
inches back from the front end is a
cross-piece that is just under ⅛” in
thickness, ¼” wide and 2½” long.
The cross-piece is on the upper side
of the spines, and is fastened by a
small ¼” brad, is lashed with
thread and coated with glue or
shellac. The other cross-piece is 1”
forward from the rear end, is of
the same dimensions in cross-section
as the forward piece, but is 8” long
and is secured in the same manner as the other, see <a id="fig_234-237"></a><a href="#fig234-237">Fig. 234</a>. The
framework is further stiffened by two fine wires that run diagonally
from the ends of one cross-piece to the ends of the other. They are
secured to the inside vertical face of the spines by means of small
pieces of tin that have two small
holes, one at each end, the one
receives a ¼” brad that is driven
into the spine, while the wire is
attached to the other hole. The
little pieces of tin are about 3/16” × ½”
and are lashed to the spine in addition
to the fastening by the small
brad. This kind of fastening prevents
slipping, also the cutting into
the wood, either of which would
destroy the efficiency of the wire. In
order to increase the tension of
the wire, a small turn-buckle is inserted,

<p>The bearings for the propeller
shafts are lashed to the outside face
of the rear end of each spine, <a href="#fig234-237">Fig. 236</a>. The bearing is a piece of brass
1/16” × ¼” × 1”, and is bent to a right angle at the middle. A small hole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
is drilled for a brad into the side of the spine and the other hole is
drilled to receive the propeller shaft, which is 1/16” steel wire. The
shaft is bent into a hook after it passes thru the bearing. To prevent
the rubber of the motor from touching the steel wire, which is
injurious to the rubber, a small rubber hose is slipped over the
hook. In this model, the propellers are pieces of veneer steamed and
pressed into the spiral shape. The propeller shaft then is bent around
the center of the propeller, has two little washers between this and the
bearing, after which comes the covered hook, see <a href="#fig234-237">Fig. 237</a>. A piece of tin
½” wide and 1¼” long is folded about the propeller before the shaft is bent
around. The shaft is soldered to the tin, the tin being secured by two
small brads and shellac. A small tin rudder with a small fold in its
upper portion may be slipped over the back cross-piece, <a id="fig_238"></a><a href="#fig238">Fig. 238</a>. The
fore plane is made of very thin spruce, shaped like <a id="fig_239-240"></a><a href="#fig239-240">Fig. 239</a>, and is bent
up almost like a butterfly’s wings, <a href="#fig239-240">Fig. 240</a>. The wood is less than
1/16” thick. A double hook as anchors for the double motors, is bent
and secured about the fore end of the framework. The hooks are
covered with the rubber hose, the same as the propeller shaft, <a id="fig_241"></a><a href="#fig241">Fig. 241</a>.</p>

<p>The large plane is 4½” in the widest place and is 20” long. It is the
shape of <a id="fig_242"></a><a href="#fig242">Fig. 242</a> in outline, the straight side being to the rear. The
outline of the plane is a steel or brass spring wire 1/16” diameter and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
spliced at the center of the long sides, being soldered at this point. The
ends of the wire lap over an inch or more. There are but two ribs
which are 5½” from the outer ends. The ribs have a slight curve upward,
most of it being near the free edge of the plane, <a id="fig_243"></a><a href="#fig243">Fig. 243</a>. The
ends of the ribs are bent at a right angle and are soldered to the outside
framework of wire. The cover of the plane is made of prepared silk
and is made ¼” larger all around than the size of the outline of the wire
frame. A ¼” hem is then turned which gives strength to the edge. The
cover is now over cast with needle and thread to the framework, stretching
fairly tight.</p>

<p>The framework of the large plane is
not secured directly to the wooden framework
of the model, but is soldered to wire
loops that in turn lie flat on top of the
spines of the frame, <a href="#fig242">Fig. 242</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>. This
gives opportunity to tie with string so as to
try out the model. If it is too far forward,
it can be slipped back and vice versa; when the correct position is
located, it is permanently wired to the wooden framework. The fore
plane is attached by means of rubber string. This is known as the Mann
monoplane, and is a commercial product.</p>

<h3>PROPELLERS,

<p>There are four kinds of propellers:</p>

<p>1. Propellers carved out of
solid and laminated blocks.</p>

<p>2. Metal propellers with curved
or twisted surfaces.</p>

<p>3. Built up propellers. In this
type a small block is used as a hub,
and the wood or metal fans are
projected out from this. The fans
are attached on the diagonal.</p>

<p>4. Propellers made of pressed
wood veneer. These are excellent,
but require more skill and more
apparatus to make.</p>

<p><i>The carved out propeller</i> is the
one most generally used and is not
only a good exercise in modeling
with a knife, but is a good serviceable
kind. There are a number of
types of propellers, named mostly
by men who have designed them.
For simplicity in laying out and
carving, I like the Langley type. A
rectangle is made of wood, say
¾” × 1½” × 6”. <a id="fig_244-251"></a><a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 244</a>. Draw the
diagonals, as in <a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 245</a>. With a
radius of ¼”, and center at the intersection
of the diagonals, draw a
half-inch circle. Connect the diagonal
lines and the circumference of the circle, as in <a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 246</a>, and cut
down to the outline as it now appears. The blank is now as shown in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
<a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 247</a>. We will now take off two big slices, not all in one cut, but in
several. <a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 248</a> has the dotted lines showing the depth to be cut, and
<a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 249</a> shows these same parts cut away. Now cut away <i>x</i> and <i>x</i> until
the blade is curved back to edges <i>z</i> and <i>z</i>. The cut away portions will
be as in <a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 250</a>. Cut the opposite side the same way, and cut away
the back corners a little, giving the result as shown in <a href="#fig244-251">Fig. 251</a>. Sandpaper
well and shellac. Drill hole carefully for the propeller shaft.</p>

<p>The principal objection to the metal propeller is the bending that
is liable to occur when the model lights, unless there are lighting devices
underneath, and they all add weight. The hub propellers may have
metal or hardwood veneers for fans. The hub may be round or square;
see Figs. <a id="fig_252"></a><a href="#fig252">252</a> and <a id="fig_253"></a><a href="#fig253">253</a>. Very good propellers may be made in this way.
Extra curvature of the outer ends of the fans is possible, <a id="fig_254"></a><a href="#fig254">Fig. 254</a>.</p>

<p><b>The veneer propeller</b> must be steamed and pressed. This is by
far the most difficult to make. The 1/16” hardwood veneer is the best.
The propeller is not reinforced to make up for the extra thickness of
the carved propeller, but is of uniform thickness thruout. The veneer
is first cut to shape in outline and then is steamed and twisted to shape.
<a id="fig_255-258"></a><a href="#fig255-258">Fig. 255</a> shows a pattern for a propeller blade. The veneer should be
steamed or soaked in hot water until the wood is very pliable and soft.
A form should be ready so as to get both wings with equal twist from
the central portion. I will suggest one, others can be devised. A clamp
is necessary for the center, which may be made as follows: take a
one-inch piece of wood about 1¼” wide and any length. Set it up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
edgewise. Make a cut 1/16” deep and one inch long across the upper
edge, <a href="#fig255-258">Fig. 256</a>, and screw a small piece over top as a clamp. After
thoroly steaming the propeller blade until it is very pliable, insert it
into the clamp at the center and twist from the straight side, one fan
up, the other down. It is not easy to get the two sides just alike, so
I recommend the bending of one side at a time, and when that is dry,
remove, and reverse the ends, being sure to keep the straight edge to
the front, or the same as before. To be accurate, there must be a guide
block to bend to. For a nine-inch propeller, a block like <a href="#fig255-258">Fig. 257</a>
would be about right. Place guide in position, press blank down to
the oblique surface and secure there until dry. Repeat for the other
end. It will be seen that the guide
block and clamp are both secured
to a board for a base; they may be
secured to a table or bench-top. A
clamp might be devised also that
would hold the propeller in a vertical
position with guide blocks on
either side of center so as to bend
and secure both ends at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Another way to bend propellers</b> is to clamp the center of the
blank in a vertical position, and with two clamps made by sawing into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the ends of two pieces of wood, <a href="#fig255-258">Fig. 258</a>, a cut wide enough to take
the thickness of the blank, and deep enough for the width, bend one
blade forward and the other back, <a id="fig_259"></a><a href="#fig259">Fig. 259</a>. The small clamps on
the propeller blades should be placed at equal distances from the center,
and should be given an equal amount of twist. The small clamps on
the blades will not be forced over until they touch the base, so blocks
of equal size should be used as stops in the operation of twisting. The
clamps should be secured in the last position by means of cord to the
base until the propeller is dry.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>Still another way to attain the twist in veneer propellers, would be
to have two blocks gouged out to the proper shape, one just fitting in
the other. After the propeller is shaped in outline and steamed, it is
placed between the two blocks, which are in turn clamped firmly together
until propeller is dry.</p>

<p><b>Motors.</b> Quite a number of devices have been tried, but the
rubber string is by far the most efficient power yet discovered. Rubber
has a great deal more power than an equal weight of steel in all ways
that steel has been tried. The power of the rubber motor is dependent
on the unwinding of the strands of rubber after having been wound up.
The longer this unwinding may be delayed the further the little air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
craft may be propelled, providing there is force enough expended at
any time to give the necessary momentum to the propeller. A long
motor has more revolutions than a short one. Hence some advocate
a long spined frame to the model aeroplane. Others prefer to cut the
frame a little shorter and give great pitch to the propeller which demands
more energy at a given time, hence heavier strands, or more
strands of the smaller rubber string. With the greater pitch propellers,
the model is propelled faster and so may cover as great or greater
distance than one with a motor that gives more revolutions in unwinding,
but it is possible to revolve so fast as not to propel at all. Many
use the 1/16” square rubber string, others the ⅛” while many use ribbon
rubber, say 1/32” to 1/16” thick by 3/16”. ¼” and 5/16” wide. For small
models, rubber bands can be looped together.</p>

<p><b>Gears.</b> Small, light weight gears can be made or bought. They
are attached to propeller shafts and are geared back different pitches.
Some one to two, others one to three, while some gears are one to one.
It might seem that one to one is added friction and no gain in winding,
but a hook is attached to each gear wheel which allows two rubber
motors instead of one, and allows longer unwinding. If the rubber
strands are divided they wind up many more turns than when combined
in one bunch. If eight strands are twisted together you cannot turn
as many times as with four strands. <a id="fig_260"></a><a href="#fig260">Fig. 260</a> shows a one to one gear
and its connections, and <a id="fig_261"></a><a href="#fig261">Fig. 261</a> a gear with a greater ratio.</p>

<p>A gear of one to one might be placed at
the opposite end of the framework from the
propeller, thus extending the number of
revolutions in that manner, the second rope
or motor extending back and below the
first, <a id="fig_262"></a><a href="#fig262">Fig. 262</a>.</p>

 <a href="#fig_262"><span class="goback">↑</span></a></p>
</div><!--end figright-->

<p><b>Winding Devices.</b> It is tiresome to
wind up the rubber motors by hand, so
mechanical winding devices have been
made. A drill with a hook in the place of
a drill-bit is quite satisfactory. It is best to have a ring on the rubber
motor where it is attached to the anchoring hook. This ring can be
hooked on the hook of the drill. This winds but one at a time, so they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
should be changed about in the winding process, first on one and then
on the other back and forth, until tight enough. A very good winder
can be made of a revolving egg-beater. The egg-beating part is cut off,
leaving two shafts instead of one. If there is a hook on each, both
motors can be wound at once and as they should be wound in opposite
directions, the device works all right.</p>

<h3>TOURNAMENTS.</h3>


<p>All of the work of construction and flying of kites is interesting and
profitable for development yet there is opportunity for furthering this
interest by bringing about yearly tournaments for the exhibition of
the many efforts in construction and design that are undertaken. The
tournaments have a further usefulness in the bringing of our schools
together in a great outdoor social event. The spirit of such an event
is excellent and the day is a joyful one to the children and parents.
Thousands attend these yearly gatherings.</p>

<p><b>The Director.</b> It is necessary for a good tournament that some
interested and competent person take general charge of the whole
affair and not leave the planning and arranging to others. Helpers
are necessary at the tournament, but preparation should be directed by
some one person. In so doing, we do not overlook the helpful cooperation
of the principals at the various schools, but seek to interest them
as to possibilities of undertakings by their children. Instructions should
be sent out from time to time as to new things to be constructed and
three or four weeks before the tournament, quite complete instructions
regarding the different events that may be entered, and rules pertaining
to each should be posted in each school.</p>

<p>It is well to organize a little in the schools that are interested.
Some boy may be recognized as a leader and a good kite maker. He
can round up the team, get the boys interested and encourage them to
enter events not yet taken so as to cover as many events as possible and
fewer in the same. The preparation for the tournament gives a great
opportunity to the teachers and principals to get in touch with boys.
Many boys have come to know their teachers with just such an introduction,
and it has been the means of starting a good many boys to
work in the schoolrooms on their studies. Some boys seem to get out
of gear with their schoolroom environment and need a little touch of
play, a tramp, or some form of sport to get them back to their real
school life. This kind of undertaking is one of the great opportunities
for the teacher to get near to the boys. Some teachers are enthusiastic
enough to send out for a good sized bundle of sticks and have some
one retail them out to the boys at cost. The boys appreciate a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
effort of this kind even if there is no prospect of a tournament. A
discussion of design in the drawing work will also be a practical departure
from the regular work, and will again arouse the lazy boy to
do his best. Now if the teacher will take some interest in the making,
even if she doesn’t know very much about it, and especially in the flying
of the kites, she will be progressing, and there are but few teachers
who cannot learn a good deal about kite making and flying, if they are
willing to try.</p>

<p>The manual training teacher and the shop are very able assistants
to the kite construction projects. In some schools, a week some time
previous to the tournament is allowed for the special construction of
kites in the shop. The boys will waste valuable lumber if allowed to
rip up thin boards, so it will pay to encourage the buying of spruce
sticks. There is much adjustment in attaching string and covering,
and putting on of the bridle; as much as possible of this should be
reserved for home work, but some might be done at school.</p>

<p><b>Suitable Location.</b> But the work at the school is not a tournament
altho an important factor of it. The director, we will call the
manager of the tournament, must find a suitable location. It must be
open to the breeze, free from wires, accessible by street car service, a
little to one side so people will have to go a little out of their way to
see it, hoodlums don’t usually care so much for beautiful things,
especially if it is some trouble to go to it, and it should be large enough
to accommodate a great many kites without getting into too close
quarters. Kites are liable to dive around somewhat, so if they are not
too thick, there is more chance to get the kite straightened up before
getting entangled in other kite lines. Now that there are so many kinds
of kites, it is necessary to locate the kinds on the field. The kites are
divided into groups when the list of events is sent out, and these groups
are placed in different locations on the field. We will suppose the
following group is to be located.</p>


<p>Group D.</p>
<p class="p0 indent5">Measured Events.</p>
<p class="p0">27. Highest Flyer—Single.</p>
<p class="p0">28. Highest Flyer—Tandem.</p>
<p class="p0">29. Highest flight in five minutes, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
On the ground, separated from the others, would be a bulletin board
that is fastened to a post and this is set in the ground. The post is
about nine feet long, and the bulletin board is nailed to it, the lower
edge being about one foot down on the post. If the post is set eighteen
inches in the ground there would be six and a half feet up to the lower
edge of bulletin. The announcements can be printed with chalk. They
stand out and can be read across the field, see <a id="fig_263"></a><a href="#fig263">Fig. 263</a>. The tournament
is always on a Saturday afternoon, so the bulletins are set Saturday

<p>If there is no space fenced off for aeroplane
model flying, and for the races, a few posts should
be set and two wires about No. 9 run around an
enclosure. Make it an enclosure, for if you don’t it
will be impossible to keep the spectators back. We
tried a V-shaped fence, but it was useless; with an
enclosure and two or three policemen about, it is
possible to keep the crowd out.</p>

<p><b>Judges.</b> Settle on your judges at least two
weeks ahead of the tournament. It will assist in
arousing interest in the schools with which they are
connected. Principals and manual training teachers
should be available and serviceable. It is not necessary
to be a kite maker to be able to judge a kite.
About three judges to a group is good, then if one fails to appear you
still have two. Try to start at the appointed time and urge your judges
to be there on time. Caution the pupils about putting their kites up
before the time, as they are so liable to accident if played with beforehand.</p>

<p>Save a place of honor for your superintendents. They may be asked
to award prize badges, or to select the prettiest kite in the air, and the
most ingenious device, the best made model or the best invention; not
all of these but something of this kind. Don’t forget to use them in
some place. Get the promise of two, three, or four policemen, a few
days ahead. The presence of a few good officers helps in curbing desires
for destruction among a few. Kites are liable to accident, so if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
can have a kite hospital where the boys can get a little paper and paste,
string or stick, it will sometimes heal quite a disappointment.</p>

<p class="p2">An information bureau is a good feature. Have a bulletin showing
its location. The judges as well as the children and parents would be
glad of some help of this kind. Official badges are given to the judges,
director, superintendents of schools, information and badges, and helpers.
The badges are given out to the officers at the information bureau. A
small stand at some prominent location in the field would be of service for
the giving of the prize badges to the winning contestants. Each winner
receives a slip, <a id="fig_264"></a><a href="#fig264">Fig. 264</a>, from one of the judges of his group, giving his
name, school, the first or second prize and event, the judge keeping a
duplicate record on a mimeographed sheet that is mounted on a piece
of cardboard, <a id="fig_265"></a><a href="#fig265">Fig. 265</a>. The pupil takes the slip to the awarding stand
and hands it to the judges. The judges turn in their records, and the
director fills out a small diploma of recognition, <a id="fig_266"></a><a href="#fig266">Fig. 266</a>, and sends it
to the school from which the boy has entered. It may be a girl; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
have had a number of winners among the girls. These slips and record
sheets for the judges will be some of the work for the director before
the tournament. Each pupil who wins in any event receives an appropriate
badge, <a id="fig_267"></a><a href="#fig267">Fig. 267</a>.</p>

<p>If it is convenient, it is always well to
have two transits give the actual heights of
high flyers. Some simple ones might be
made, but there are often students who
would like the opportunity to do some work
of the kind for practice. It is well to send
out a printed list of the winners to all the
schools after the tournament. It might be
written as follows</p>

<p>25. Highest Flyer—Tandem.</p>
<p class="p0 indent5a">First. Albert Johnson, 24 St. School.</p>
<p class="p0 indent5a">Second. Victor Wagoner, Washington St. School.</p>

<p>In sending out notices before and after,
request the principals to place them in a
conspicuous place for the boys to see. The
principal’s office is not a good place, for
some will not go to the office to study them,
these boys may be just as interested but they
don’t care to have us know it. If the
material is where the boys can see it easily
they sometimes get interested unawares to
themselves. All plans should be placed in
an open place.</p>

<h3>TOURNAMENTS, CONTINUED.</h3>


<p>The newspapers are glad to publish notices and pictures, and some
will even print plans of work free. They are very persistent in getting
reports of the tournament, so the judges should be careful in recording
each event. The reporters will be on the ground if they have knowledge
of its whereabouts.</p>

<p>Ice cream and sandwich wagons are liable to get in the way, so it
is best to restrict them to the margin of the crowd. They should not
be allowed to come inside any of the locations for the events.</p>

<p>All string that is to be used in races of any kind should be measured
beforehand. It is best for the director to take charge of the string until
time for the event, or until he can turn it over to the judges in charge
of that group. Boys are liable to make a mistake in getting their string
too short, so it must be measured. I place a couple of nails one hundred
feet apart in the rail of the board fence, the boys wind about that
until they have the required length, and by counting the string I can soon
see if it is correct. If the string is given back to the boy, there is a
temptation to take out some. There is no disadvantage in letting out
the string from a stick in the races, if there is a reel to attach it to when
it comes to the winding in.</p>

<p>Announcements should be sent out a week ahead of the tournament
that the string will be measured such and such afternoons, perhaps two
days before the tournament. It is not best to leave it until just the
day before, as the director should be as free as possible from such work
at such time in order to give full attention to rounding up of details
that are sure to accumulate toward the last of the preparations.</p>

<p><b>Quarter Mile Dash.</b> The race consists of the letting out and
winding in of a kite on one quarter mile of string. The boys set their
reels ready for the best speed and they group themselves quite close
together, but far enough apart to prevent mix-ups, and at the proper
time are handed their string that has been measured and labeled which
they attach to kite. Each boy in the race is allowed one helper and the
kite may be held by the helper a hundred feet away, ready to toss it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the air at the sign for starting. When all is ready, the one in charge of
the group calls “ready! go!” The kites are tossed up and are given the
string as fast as it will be taken. The boy with a steady head will
sometimes stop playing out and work his kite up a little to get more
breeze. If there is plenty of breeze, they are fed all the string as fast
as it is pulled out. If a kite drops it may be worked up again, but it
must go to the end of the quarter mile and back. A time keeper is
placed by each contestant, and officers are needed to keep back the onlookers.
As soon as all the string is out the boy slips the loop on the
end of his string over a hook on the reel and winds in as fast as he
can turn. The kite mounts up in the air and is pulled with great
violence toward the reel. If a string breaks, the time keeper stops
the winding until the kite is again attached. No allowance is made for
mishaps. The kite that is jerked down into the reel first is winner, and
the owner is usually a pretty warm boy. The helper can take turns in
winding.</p>

<p>Other races should be similarly conducted. We have had races in
the construction of a tailless kite, including the lashing and stringing of
framework and covering, attaching of bridle and the kite must fly. In
all pulling contests, spring scales are used. In the light weights, the
twenty-five pound scales are best, but the fifty pound is more serviceable
for all around purposes. For very heavy pulling, large ice scales might
be borrowed for the day from some hardware man.</p>

<p>To measure the pull of a kite, the string is looped about the hook
of the spring and the record made. Several records are made of each
kite over a period of about thirty minutes or so. The judges going to
and fro measuring this one and that. The kite should be ascending to
get the best register. It is well in trial events to set the number of times
that each aeroplane may be tried or tests of pulling permitted, as some
will tease for a continual performance.</p>

<p>The art supervisors and teachers are good as judges for the artistic
events. All kites are in the air most of the time, so a general survey
is made of the whole field. It is well to have about five judges on this
group. Less will do the work all right, but it is well to draw many
into the service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
If the director could be on horseback so as to be easily seen, and
also be able to get about easily, it would help out considerably. Messengers
from judges to director or information would be useful.</p>

<p><b>Badges.</b> For badges, we use a celluloid button, with our own cut,
the ribbon attached has printing in black. The officers get yellow, the
first prize, blue, the second, red. Some years we have used different
colored buttons, this year the buttons were all yellow, the ribbons,
yellow, red, and blue.</p>

<p>See the street car officials in order that they may plan accommodations
for the day. Instructions are posted for the car men by the officials,
that consideration be given to the boys with their kites and in most cases
the men have been very helpful in this respect. Of course large kites
cannot be taken on the street car. A great many are taken to the
field in automobiles.</p>

<p>Just before the tournament it is rather difficult to locate the boys
making their kites, as they work in secluded places, but if you know of
some that are making progress, a photograph by the newspaper men will
add considerable zest to the advertising side of preparations.</p>

<p>Get your school officials enthusiastic first, and get their cooperation
in encouraging the undertaking, for it is a great school social gathering
and should be made worth while. Then boost for it. Demonstrate by
making or flying a kite, and the boys will take care of the rest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>New Year’s Greeting to the</p>

<p>Kite Makers of Los Angeles:</p>


<p>The Sixth Annual Kite Tournament will be held April 20, 1912,
at Exposition Park. The spring vacation will be a good time to design,
construct, and try out new ideas. The model aeroplanes will have a
much larger place than heretofore at the coming tournament. A number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
of good plans of kites and model aeroplanes will be sent out during the
coming season.</p>

<p>Spruce sticks can be obtained again this year at 1335 E. 6th St. at
the Southern California Box Co., in 25c bundles or more.</p>

<p>The Goodyear Rubber Co., No. 324 S. Broadway is carrying string
rubber and will have one sixteenth and one eighth inch, very good sizes.
Models propelled by rubber bands should be from 20” to 30” across.
Do not make the planes too wide, much of the failure of models is due
to this mistake.</p>

<p>Two firms in the east are advertising small gasoline motors for
model aeroplanes. Models to carry these motors should be from 6’ to
8’ or more. Models so equipped are operated by cords running to the
ground. One boy claims to have succeeded with a storage battery under
his arm and an Ajax motor in his model. If we get our model well
under control we should be able to carry the storage battery on a wheel
as suggested two years ago. No one has reported a success with the
clockspring device. A long coiled steel wire spring has more promising
possibilities.</p>

<p>Look for advertisements in “<i>Popular Mechanics</i>” and other magazines,
for firms carrying parts such as gears, rubber motors, etc. There
will be a few events for commercially manufactured models, but these
are not to compete with home made.</p>

<p>The usual kite events will be about the same as during the past two
years. The quarter mile dash with the use of reels will be used; also
an eighth mile dash will be listed this year in which the string is to be
wound in by hand.</p>

<p>The “<i>Scientific American</i>” of October 14, 1911, has an article on
“How to make a Model Aeroplane that will fly 700 feet”. Look it
up.</p>

<p>Ask at the libraries for Mr. Collin’s books on “Model Aeroplanes”.
There is a second book out by this author that seems very good.</p>

<p>Look out for ideas in the daily newspapers and at the Dominguez
meet.</p>

<p>Principals please post.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>Kite making and kite flying have been enjoyed for centuries in the
orient and for a good many years in this country, and will continue as
a seasonal sport for perhaps all time. It can be made more interesting
and useful by a little cooperation on the part of the grown-ups. It may
be only expression of appreciation of the effort put forth by some
otherwise idle fellow, or it may be in the form of a request of teacher
to pupil for a nice kite as a gift for a third party, or it may be the
arousing of school spirit for the best showing at a tournament, it might
be assistance rendered in planning a beautiful kite, and it might be a
great many other things that have not been mentioned. Kite making
will not catch and make good every boy, even with the best efforts of
the best teachers, but it will go farther than any other enticement toward
bringing about good comradeship between teacher and scholar, which is
half the battle with uncertain temperaments in some boys. We need to
come shoulder to shoulder with the boys to help them most.</p>

<p>But the merits of kite making go farther than the social relationship,
it arouses the inventive spirit in the boy, fills in many otherwise idle
hours with good healthy sport that occupies the children out of doors.
It is not wasted time unless indulged in to too great excess, but new
developments bring about new studies of the kite problems that are as
good for the boys as problems of other subjects like arithmetic and
geometry for we must remember that boys have subject of study not
found in text-books.</p>

<p>Someone told me not long ago that “no one could think an evil
thought while looking up”. Some one else has written, “If the outlook
is not good, try the uplook”. This latter has a greater significance than
would be generally applied to boys flying kites, but who knows what
boys are really thinking about; maybe we underestimate their abilities
and inclinations. Our boys often need more persistency of effort, and
must be held to their jobs by much attention on the part of overseers.
Most boys will stick to kite making against great discouragement and
some will continue, for long periods, working patiently and carefully
until they succeed. The string is often a source of great annoyance, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
snarls up and some lads will cut out the hard knots, but others will
tackle the knotty problems and untangle them, they will do the same
with knotty problems in life later on. It is patience that wins in many
a tangled strife. Boys do not as a rule have as good feeling for color
harmony, or so the ladies think, as the girls; help the boys out a little
on their color combinations on their kites. It may be the first time the
boy has had a problem of his own in color work.</p>

<p>Perhaps the little aeroplane does not go very far, it looks like a
failure. Do you look on and pass on? If the model goes at all by its
own power, that boy has made a something that has overcome the force
of gravity to the extent of traveling transversely to its downward pull.
Recognize it, and encourage the boy. There is a difference between
flinging one so that it will travel for a short distance, and releasing one
that travels by its own power. The former may be a deception. Give
credit where credit is due.</p>

<p>The balloons have very little lifting power, but the force of gravity
has been overcome, two gases of unequal density have been placed in
juxtaposition and the lighter one goes up. So we might go on with
each of the subjects attempted in this book. There has been great
demand for the briefer treatise, and I hope this little book may have
met the expectancy of its readers more than half way.</p>

<p>Remember it is not just the pretty kite soaring high in the sky;
remember there is a BOY at the other end of the kite line. Boost
for him.</p>
